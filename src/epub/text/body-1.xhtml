    <h2>
      PREFACE TO THE 1857 EDITION
</h2>

    <p>
I have been occupied with this story, during many working hours of two
      years. I must have been very ill employed, if I could not leave its merits
      and demerits as a whole, to express themselves on its being read as a
      whole. But, as it is not unreasonable to suppose that I may have held its
      threads with a more continuous attention than anyone else can have given
      them during its desultory publication, it is not unreasonable to ask that
      the weaving may be looked at in its completed state, and with the pattern
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I might offer any apology for so exaggerated a fiction as the Barnacles
      and the Circumlocution Office, I would seek it in the common experience of
      an Englishman, without presuming to mention the unimportant fact of my
      having done that violence to good manners, in the days of a Russian war,
      and of a Court of Inquiry at Chelsea. If I might make so bold as to defend
      that extravagant conception, Mr Merdle, I would hint that it originated
      after the Railroad-share epoch, in the times of a certain Irish bank, and
      of one or two other equally laudable enterprises. If I were to plead
      anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design will
      sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious design, it would
      be the curious coincidence that it has been brought to its climax in these
      pages, in the days of the public examination of late Directors of a Royal
      British Bank. But, I submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on
      all these counts, if need be, and to accept the assurance (on good
      authority) that nothing like them was ever known in this land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether or no
      any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing. I did not know,
      myself, until the sixth of this present month, when I went to look. I
      found the outer front courtyard, often mentioned here, metamorphosed into
      a butter shop; and I then almost gave up every brick of the jail for lost.
      Wandering, however, down a certain adjacent ‘Angel Court, leading to
      Bermondsey’, I came to ‘Marshalsea Place:’ the houses in which I
      recognised, not only as the great block of the former prison, but as
      preserving the rooms that arose in my mind’s-eye when I became Little
      Dorrit’s biographer. The smallest boy I ever conversed with, carrying the
      largest baby I ever saw, offered a supernaturally intelligent explanation
      of the locality in its old uses, and was very nearly correct. How this
      young Newton (for such I judge him to be) came by his information, I don’t
      know; he was a quarter of a century too young to know anything about it of
      himself. I pointed to the window of the room where Little Dorrit was born,
      and where her father lived so long, and asked him what was the name of the
      lodger who tenanted that apartment at present? He said, ‘Tom Pythick.’ I
      asked him who was Tom Pythick? and he said, ‘Joe Pythick’s uncle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A little further on, I found the older and smaller wall, which used to
      enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for
      ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel
      Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones
      of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its narrow yard to the right and
      to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were
      lowered when the place got free; will look upon rooms in which the debtors
      lived; and will stand among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Preface to Bleak House I remarked that I had never had so many
      readers. In the Preface to its next successor, Little Dorrit, I have still
      to repeat the same words. Deeply sensible of the affection and confidence
      that have grown up between us, I add to this Preface, as I added to that,
      May we meet again!

	</hgroup>
    <p>Thirty years ago, Marseilles lay burning in the sun, one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern
      France then, than at any other time, before or since. Everything in
      Marseilles, and about Marseilles, had stared at the fervid sky, and been
      stared at in return, until a staring habit had become universal there.
      Strangers were stared out of countenance by staring white houses, staring
      white walls, staring white streets, staring tracts of arid road, staring
      hills from which verdure was burnt away. The only things to be seen not
      fixedly staring and glaring were the vines drooping under their load of
      grapes. These did occasionally wink a little, as the hot air barely moved
      their faint leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour,
      or on the beautiful sea without. The line of demarcation between the two
      colours, black and blue, showed the point which the pure sea would not
      pass; but it lay as quiet as the abominable pool, with which it never
      mixed. Boats without awnings were too hot to touch; ships blistered at
      their moorings; the stones of the quays had not cooled, night or day, for
      months. Hindoos, Russians, Chinese, Spaniards, Portuguese, Englishmen,
      Frenchmen, Genoese, Neapolitans, Venetians, Greeks, Turks, descendants
      from all the builders of Babel, come to trade at Marseilles, sought the
      shade alike—taking refuge in any hiding-place from a sea too
      intensely blue to be looked at, and a sky of purple, set with one great
      flaming jewel of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The universal stare made the eyes ache. Towards the distant line of
      Italian coast, indeed, it was a little relieved by light clouds of mist,
      slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea, but it softened nowhere
      else. Far away the staring roads, deep in dust, stared from the hill-side,
      stared from the hollow, stared from the interminable plain. Far away the
      dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages, and the monotonous wayside
      avenues of parched trees without shade, drooped beneath the stare of earth
      and sky. So did the horses with drowsy bells, in long files of carts,
      creeping slowly towards the interior; so did their recumbent drivers, when
      they were awake, which rarely happened; so did the exhausted labourers in
      the fields. Everything that lived or grew, was oppressed by the glare;
      except the lizard, passing swiftly over rough stone walls, and the cicala,
      chirping his dry hot chirp, like a rattle. The very dust was scorched
      brown, and something quivered in the atmosphere as if the air itself were
      panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blinds, shutters, curtains, awnings, were all closed and drawn to keep out
      the stare. Grant it but a chink or keyhole, and it shot in like a
      white-hot arrow. The churches were the freest from it. To come out of the
      twilight of pillars and arches—dreamily dotted with winking lamps,
      dreamily peopled with ugly old shadows piously dozing, spitting, and
      begging—was to plunge into a fiery river, and swim for life to the
      nearest strip of shade. So, with people lounging and lying wherever shade
      was, with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs, with occasional
      jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious drums,
      Marseilles, a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted, lay broiling in the
      sun one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Marseilles that day there was a villainous prison. In one of its
      chambers, so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at
      it, and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for
      itself, were two men. Besides the two men, a notched and disfigured bench,
      immovable from the wall, with a draught-board rudely hacked upon it with a
      knife, a set of draughts, made of old buttons and soup bones, a set of
      dominoes, two mats, and two or three wine bottles. That was all the
      chamber held, exclusive of rats and other unseen vermin, in addition to
      the seen vermin, the two men.
    </p>

    </h5>

    <p>
      It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned
      like a pretty large window, by means of which it could be always inspected
      from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave. There was a broad
      strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into
      the masonry, three or four feet above the ground. Upon it, one of the two
      men lolled, half sitting and half lying, with his knees drawn up, and his
      feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture. The
      bars were wide enough apart to admit of his thrusting his arm through to
      the elbow; and so he held on negligently, for his greater ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A prison taint was on everything there. The imprisoned air, the imprisoned
      light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all deteriorated by
      confinement. As the captive men were faded and haggard, so the iron was
      rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air was faint, the
      light was dim. Like a well, like a vault, like a tomb, the prison had no
      knowledge of the brightness outside, and would have kept its polluted
      atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the Indian ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled. He jerked
      his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one
      shoulder, and growled, ‘To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that never
      shines in here!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was waiting to be fed, looking sideways through the bars that he might
      see the further down the stairs, with much of the expression of a wild
      beast in similar expectation. But his eyes, too close together, were not
      so nobly set in his head as those of the king of beasts are in his, and
      they were sharp rather than bright—pointed weapons with little
      surface to betray them. They had no depth or change; they glittered, and
      they opened and shut. So far, and waiving their use to himself, a
      clockmaker could have made a better pair. He had a hook nose, handsome
      after its kind, but too high between the eyes by probably just as much as
      his eyes were too near to one another. For the rest, he was large and tall
      in frame, had thin lips, where his thick moustache showed them at all, and
      a quantity of dry hair, of no definable colour, in its shaggy state, but
      shot with red. The hand with which he held the grating (seamed all over
      the back with ugly scratches newly healed), was unusually small and plump;
      would have been unusually white but for the prison grime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man was lying on the stone floor, covered with a coarse brown
      coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Get up, pig!’ growled the first. ‘Don’t sleep when I am hungry.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s all one, master,’ said the pig, in a submissive manner, and not
      without cheerfulness; ‘I can wake when I will, I can sleep when I will.
      It’s all the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said it, he rose, shook himself, scratched himself, tied his brown
      coat loosely round his neck by the sleeves (he had previously used it as a
      coverlet), and sat down upon the pavement yawning, with his back against
      the wall opposite to the grating.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Say what the hour is,’ grumbled the first man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The mid-day bells will ring—in forty minutes.’ When he made the
      little pause, he had looked round the prison-room, as if for certain
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are a clock. How is it that you always know?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How can I say? I always know what the hour is, and where I am. I was
      brought in here at night, and out of a boat, but I know where I am. See
      here! Marseilles harbour;’ on his knees on the pavement, mapping it all
      out with a swarthy forefinger; ‘Toulon (where the galleys are), Spain over
      there, Algiers over <i>there</i>. Creeping away to the left here, Nice.
      Round by the Cornice to Genoa. Genoa Mole and Harbour. Quarantine Ground.
      City there; terrace gardens blushing with the bella donna. Here, Porto
      Fino. Stand out for Leghorn. Out again for Civita Vecchia, so away to—hey!
      there’s no room for Naples;’ he had got to the wall by this time; ‘but
      it’s all one; it’s in there!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained on his knees, looking up at his fellow-prisoner with a lively
      look for a prison. A sunburnt, quick, lithe, little man, though rather
      thickset. Earrings in his brown ears, white teeth lighting up his
      grotesque brown face, intensely black hair clustering about his brown
      throat, a ragged red shirt open at his brown breast. Loose, seaman-like
      trousers, decent shoes, a long red cap, a red sash round his waist, and a
      knife in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Judge if I come back from Naples as I went! See here, my master! Civita
      Vecchia, Leghorn, Porto Fino, Genoa, Cornice, Off Nice (which is in
      there), Marseilles, you and me. The apartment of the jailer and his keys
      is where I put this thumb; and here at my wrist they keep the national
      razor in its case—the guillotine locked up.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man spat suddenly on the pavement, and gurgled in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some lock below gurgled in <i>its</i> throat immediately afterwards, and
      then a door crashed. Slow steps began ascending the stairs; the prattle of
      a sweet little voice mingled with the noise they made; and the
      prison-keeper appeared carrying his daughter, three or four years old, and
      a basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How goes the world this forenoon, gentlemen? My little one, you see,
      going round with me to have a peep at her father’s birds. Fie, then! Look
      at the birds, my pretty, look at the birds.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked sharply at the birds himself, as he held the child up at the
      grate, especially at the little bird, whose activity he seemed to
      mistrust. ‘I have brought your bread, Signor John Baptist,’ said he (they
      all spoke in French, but the little man was an Italian); ‘and if I might
      recommend you not to game—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t recommend the master!’ said John Baptist, showing his teeth as
      he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! but the master wins,’ returned the jailer, with a passing look of no
      particular liking at the other man, ‘and you lose. It’s quite another
      thing. You get husky bread and sour drink by it; and he gets sausage of
      Lyons, veal in savoury jelly, white bread, strachino cheese, and good wine
      by it. Look at the birds, my pretty!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Poor birds!’ said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair little face, touched with divine compassion, as it peeped
      shrinkingly through the grate, was like an angel’s in the prison. John
      Baptist rose and moved towards it, as if it had a good attraction for him.
      The other bird remained as before, except for an impatient glance at the
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay!’ said the jailer, putting his little daughter on the outer ledge of
      the grate, ‘she shall feed the birds. This big loaf is for Signor John
      Baptist. We must break it to get it through into the cage. So, there’s a
      tame bird to kiss the little hand! This sausage in a vine leaf is for
      Monsieur Rigaud. Again—this veal in savoury jelly is for Monsieur
      Rigaud. Again—these three white little loaves are for Monsieur
      Rigaud. Again, this cheese—again, this wine—again, this
      tobacco—all for Monsieur Rigaud. Lucky bird!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The child put all these things between the bars into the soft, Smooth,
      well-shaped hand, with evident dread—more than once drawing back her
      own and looking at the man with her fair brow roughened into an expression
      half of fright and half of anger. Whereas she had put the lump of coarse
      bread into the swart, scaled, knotted hands of John Baptist (who had
      scarcely as much nail on his eight fingers and two thumbs as would have
      made out one for Monsieur Rigaud), with ready confidence; and, when he
      kissed her hand, had herself passed it caressingly over his face. Monsieur
      Rigaud, indifferent to this distinction, propitiated the father by
      laughing and nodding at the daughter as often as she gave him anything;
      and, so soon as he had all his viands about him in convenient nooks of the
      ledge on which he rested, began to eat with an appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Monsieur Rigaud laughed, a change took place in his face, that was
      more remarkable than prepossessing. His moustache went up under his nose,
      and his nose came down over his moustache, in a very sinister and cruel
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There!’ said the jailer, turning his basket upside down to beat the
      crumbs out, ‘I have expended all the money I received; here is the note of
      it, and <i>that’s</i> a thing accomplished. Monsieur Rigaud, as I expected
      yesterday, the President will look for the pleasure of your society at an
      hour after mid-day, to-day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To try me, eh?’ said Rigaud, pausing, knife in hand and morsel in mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have said it. To try you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There is no news for me?’ asked John Baptist, who had begun, contentedly,
      to munch his bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lady of mine! Am I to lie here all my life, my father?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What do I know!’ cried the jailer, turning upon him with southern
      quickness, and gesticulating with both his hands and all his fingers, as
      if he were threatening to tear him to pieces. ‘My friend, how is it
      possible for me to tell how long you are to lie here? What do I know, John
      Baptist Cavalletto? Death of my life! There are prisoners here sometimes,
      who are not in such a devil of a hurry to be tried.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to glance obliquely at Monsieur Rigaud in this remark; but
      Monsieur Rigaud had already resumed his meal, though not with quite so
      quick an appetite as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Adieu, my birds!’ said the keeper of the prison, taking his pretty child
      in his arms, and dictating the words with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Adieu, my birds!’ the pretty child repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her innocent face looked back so brightly over his shoulder, as he walked
      away with her, singing her the song of the child’s game:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ‘Who passes by this road so late?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Compagnon de la Majolaine!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Who passes by this road so late?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Always gay!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      that John Baptist felt it a point of honour to reply at the grate, and in
      good time and tune, though a little hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ‘Of all the king’s knights ‘tis the flower,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Compagnon de la Majolaine!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of all the king’s knights ‘tis the flower,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Always gay!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Which accompanied them so far down the few steep stairs, that the
      prison-keeper had to stop at last for his little daughter to hear the song
      out, and repeat the Refrain while they were yet in sight. Then the child’s
      head disappeared, and the prison-keeper’s head disappeared, but the little
      voice prolonged the strain until the door clashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Rigaud, finding the listening John Baptist in his way before the
      echoes had ceased (even the echoes were the weaker for imprisonment, and
      seemed to lag), reminded him with a push of his foot that he had better
      resume his own darker place. The little man sat down again upon the
      pavement with the negligent ease of one who was thoroughly accustomed to
      pavements; and placing three hunks of coarse bread before himself, and
      falling to upon a fourth, began contentedly to work his way through them
      as if to clear them off were a sort of game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he glanced at the Lyons sausage, and perhaps he glanced at the
      veal in savoury jelly, but they were not there long, to make his mouth
      water; Monsieur Rigaud soon dispatched them, in spite of the president and
      tribunal, and proceeded to suck his fingers as clean as he could, and to
      wipe them on his vine leaves. Then, as he paused in his drink to
      contemplate his fellow-prisoner, his moustache went up, and his nose came
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do you find the bread?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A little dry, but I have my old sauce here,’ returned John Baptist,
      holding up his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How sauce?’ 
    </p>

      ‘I can cut my bread so—like a melon. Or so—like an omelette.
      Or so—like a fried fish. Or so—like Lyons sausage,’ said John
      Baptist, demonstrating the various cuts on the bread he held, and soberly
      chewing what he had in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here!’ cried Monsieur Rigaud. ‘You may drink. You may finish this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no great gift, for there was mighty little wine left; but Signor
      Cavalletto, jumping to his feet, received the bottle gratefully, turned it
      upside down at his mouth, and smacked his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Put the bottle by with the rest,’ said Rigaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man obeyed his orders, and stood ready to give him a lighted
      match; for he was now rolling his tobacco into cigarettes by the aid of
      little squares of paper which had been brought in with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here! You may have one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A thousand thanks, my master!’ John Baptist said in his own language, and
      with the quick conciliatory manner of his own countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Rigaud arose, lighted a cigarette, put the rest of his stock into
      a breast-pocket, and stretched himself out at full length upon the bench.
      Cavalletto sat down on the pavement, holding one of his ankles in each
      hand, and smoking peacefully. There seemed to be some uncomfortable
      attraction of Monsieur Rigaud’s eyes to the immediate neighbourhood of
      that part of the pavement where the thumb had been in the plan. They were
      so drawn in that direction, that the Italian more than once followed them
      to and back from the pavement in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What an infernal hole this is!’ said Monsieur Rigaud, breaking a long
      pause. ‘Look at the light of day. Day? the light of yesterday week, the
      light of six months ago, the light of six years ago. So slack and dead!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It came languishing down a square funnel that blinded a window in the
      staircase wall, through which the sky was never seen—nor anything
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cavalletto,’ said Monsieur Rigaud, suddenly withdrawing his gaze from
      this funnel to which they had both involuntarily turned their eyes, ‘you
      know me for a gentleman?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Surely, surely!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How long have we been here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I, eleven weeks, to-morrow night at midnight. You, nine weeks and three
      days, at five this afternoon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have I ever done anything here? Ever touched the broom, or spread the
      mats, or rolled them up, or found the draughts, or collected the dominoes,
      or put my hand to any kind of work?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you ever thought of looking to me to do any kind of work?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist answered with that peculiar back-handed shake of the right
      forefinger which is the most expressive negative in the Italian language.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No! You knew from the first moment when you saw me here, that I was a
      gentleman?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘ALTRO!’ returned John Baptist, closing his eyes and giving his head a
      most vehement toss. The word being, according to its Genoese emphasis, a
      confirmation, a contradiction, an assertion, a denial, a taunt, a
      compliment, a joke, and fifty other things, became in the present
      instance, with a significance beyond all power of written expression, our
      familiar English ‘I believe you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Haha! You are right! A gentleman I am! And a gentleman I’ll live, and a
      gentleman I’ll die! It’s my intent to be a gentleman. It’s my game. Death
      of my soul, I play it out wherever I go!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed his posture to a sitting one, crying with a triumphant air:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here I am! See me! Shaken out of destiny’s dice-box into the company of a
      mere smuggler;—shut up with a poor little contraband trader, whose
      papers are wrong, and whom the police lay hold of besides, for placing his
      boat (as a means of getting beyond the frontier) at the disposition of
      other little people whose papers are wrong; and he instinctively
      recognises my position, even by this light and in this place. It’s well
      done! By Heaven! I win, however the game goes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his moustache went up, and his nose came down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s the hour now?’ he asked, with a dry hot pallor upon him, rather
      difficult of association with merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A little half-hour after mid-day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good! The President will have a gentleman before him soon. Come! Shall I
      tell you on what accusation? It must be now, or never, for I shall not
      return here. Either I shall go free, or I shall go to be made ready for
      shaving. You know where they keep the razor.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Signor Cavalletto took his cigarette from between his parted lips, and
      showed more momentary discomfiture than might have been expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am a’—Monsieur Rigaud stood up to say it—‘I am a
      cosmopolitan gentleman. I own no particular country. My father was Swiss—Canton
      de Vaud. My mother was French by blood, English by birth. I myself was
      born in Belgium. I am a citizen of the world.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His theatrical air, as he stood with one arm on his hip within the folds
      of his cloak, together with his manner of disregarding his companion and
      addressing the opposite wall instead, seemed to intimate that he was
      rehearsing for the President, whose examination he was shortly to undergo,
      rather than troubling himself merely to enlighten so small a person as
      John Baptist Cavalletto.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Call me five-and-thirty years of age. I have seen the world. I have lived
      here, and lived there, and lived like a gentleman everywhere. I have been
      treated and respected as a gentleman universally. If you try to prejudice
      me by making out that I have lived by my wits—how do your lawyers
      live—your politicians—your intriguers—your men of the
      Exchange?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his small smooth hand in constant requisition, as if it were a
      witness to his gentility that had often done him good service before.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Two years ago I came to Marseilles. I admit that I was poor; I had been
      ill. When your lawyers, your politicians, your intriguers, your men of the
      Exchange fall ill, and have not scraped money together, <i>they</i> become
      poor. I put up at the Cross of Gold,—kept then by Monsieur Henri
      Barronneau—sixty-five at least, and in a failing state of health. I
      had lived in the house some four months when Monsieur Henri Barronneau had
      the misfortune to die;—at any rate, not a rare misfortune, that. It
      happens without any aid of mine, pretty often.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist having smoked his cigarette down to his fingers’ ends,
      Monsieur Rigaud had the magnanimity to throw him another. He lighted the
      second at the ashes of the first, and smoked on, looking sideways at his
      companion, who, preoccupied with his own case, hardly looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Monsieur Barronneau left a widow. She was two-and-twenty. She had gained
      a reputation for beauty, and (which is often another thing) was beautiful.
      I continued to live at the Cross of Gold. I married Madame Barronneau. It
      is not for me to say whether there was any great disparity in such a
      match. Here I stand, with the contamination of a jail upon me; but it is
      possible that you may think me better suited to her than her former
      husband was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a certain air of being a handsome man—which he was not; and a
      certain air of being a well-bred man—which he was not. It was mere
      swagger and challenge; but in this particular, as in many others,
      blustering assertion goes for proof, half over the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Be it as it may, Madame Barronneau approved of me. <i>That</i> is not to
      prejudice me, I hope?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye happening to light upon John Baptist with this inquiry, that
      little man briskly shook his head in the negative, and repeated in an
      argumentative tone under his breath, altro, altro, altro, altro—an
      infinite number of times.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now came the difficulties of our position. I am proud. I say nothing in
      defence of pride, but I am proud. It is also my character to govern. I
      can’t submit; I must govern. Unfortunately, the property of Madame Rigaud
      was settled upon herself. Such was the insane act of her late husband.
      More unfortunately still, she had relations. When a wife’s relations
      interpose against a husband who is a gentleman, who is proud, and who must
      govern, the consequences are inimical to peace. There was yet another
      source of difference between us. Madame Rigaud was unfortunately a little
      vulgar. I sought to improve her manners and ameliorate her general tone;
      she (supported in this likewise by her relations) resented my endeavours.
      Quarrels began to arise between us; and, propagated and exaggerated by the
      slanders of the relations of Madame Rigaud, to become notorious to the
      neighbours. It has been said that I treated Madame Rigaud with cruelty. I
      may have been seen to slap her face—nothing more. I have a light
      hand; and if I have been seen apparently to correct Madame Rigaud in that
      manner, I have done it almost playfully.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      If the playfulness of Monsieur Rigaud were at all expressed by his smile
      at this point, the relations of Madame Rigaud might have said that they
      would have much preferred his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sensitive and brave. I do not advance it as a merit to be sensitive
      and brave, but it is my character. If the male relations of Madame Rigaud
      had put themselves forward openly, I should have known how to deal with
      them. They knew that, and their machinations were conducted in secret;
      consequently, Madame Rigaud and I were brought into frequent and
      unfortunate collision. Even when I wanted any little sum of money for my
      personal expenses, I could not obtain it without collision—and I,
      too, a man whose character it is to govern! One night, Madame Rigaud and
      myself were walking amicably—I may say like lovers—on a height
      overhanging the sea. An evil star occasioned Madame Rigaud to advert to
      her relations; I reasoned with her on that subject, and remonstrated on
      the want of duty and devotion manifested in her allowing herself to be
      influenced by their jealous animosity towards her husband. Madame Rigaud
      retorted; I retorted; Madame Rigaud grew warm; I grew warm, and provoked
      her. I admit it. Frankness is a part of my character. At length, Madame
      Rigaud, in an access of fury that I must ever deplore, threw herself upon
      me with screams of passion (no doubt those that were overheard at some
      distance), tore my clothes, tore my hair, lacerated my hands, trampled and
      trod the dust, and finally leaped over, dashing herself to death upon the
      rocks below. Such is the train of incidents which malice has perverted
      into my endeavouring to force from Madame Rigaud a relinquishment of her
      rights; and, on her persistence in a refusal to make the concession I
      required, struggling with her—assassinating her!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped aside to the ledge where the vine leaves yet lay strewn about,
      collected two or three, and stood wiping his hands upon them, with his
      back to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,’ he demanded after a silence, ‘have you nothing to say to all
      that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s ugly,’ returned the little man, who had risen, and was brightening
      his knife upon his shoe, as he leaned an arm against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What do you mean?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist polished his knife in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you mean that I have not represented the case correctly?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Al-tro!’ returned John Baptist. The word was an apology now, and stood
      for ‘Oh, by no means!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Presidents and tribunals are so prejudiced.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well,’ cried the other, uneasily flinging the end of his cloak over his
      shoulder with an oath, ‘let them do their worst!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Truly I think they will,’ murmured John Baptist to himself, as he bent
      his head to put his knife in his sash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said on either side, though they both began walking to
      and fro, and necessarily crossed at every turn. Monsieur Rigaud sometimes
      stopped, as if he were going to put his case in a new light, or make some
      irate remonstrance; but Signor Cavalletto continuing to go slowly to and
      fro at a grotesque kind of jog-trot pace with his eyes turned downward,
      nothing came of these inclinings.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by the noise of the key in the lock arrested them both. The sound
      of voices succeeded, and the tread of feet. The door clashed, the voices
      and the feet came on, and the prison-keeper slowly ascended the stairs,
      followed by a guard of soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, Monsieur Rigaud,’ said he, pausing for a moment at the grate, with
      his keys in his hands, ‘have the goodness to come out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am to depart in state, I see?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, unless you did,’ returned the jailer, ‘you might depart in so many
      pieces that it would be difficult to get you together again. There’s a
      crowd, Monsieur Rigaud, and it doesn’t love you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on out of sight, and unlocked and unbarred a low door in the
      corner of the chamber. ‘Now,’ said he, as he opened it and appeared
      within, ‘come out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no sort of whiteness in all the hues under the sun at all like
      the whiteness of Monsieur Rigaud’s face as it was then. Neither is there
      any expression of the human countenance at all like that expression in
      every little line of which the frightened heart is seen to beat. Both are
      conventionally compared with death; but the difference is the whole deep
      gulf between the struggle done, and the fight at its most desperate
      extremity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lighted another of his paper cigars at his companion’s; put it tightly
      between his teeth; covered his head with a soft slouched hat; threw the
      end of his cloak over his shoulder again; and walked out into the side
      gallery on which the door opened, without taking any further notice of
      Signor Cavalletto. As to that little man himself, his whole attention had
      become absorbed in getting near the door and looking out at it. Precisely
      as a beast might approach the opened gate of his den and eye the freedom
      beyond, he passed those few moments in watching and peering, until the
      door was closed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an officer in command of the soldiers; a stout, serviceable,
      profoundly calm man, with his drawn sword in his hand, smoking a cigar. He
      very briefly directed the placing of Monsieur Rigaud in the midst of the
      party, put himself with consummate indifference at their head, gave the
      word ‘march!’ and so they all went jingling down the staircase. The door
      clashed—the key turned—and a ray of unusual light, and a
      breath of unusual air, seemed to have passed through the jail, vanishing
      in a tiny wreath of smoke from the cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, in his captivity, like a lower animal—like some impatient
      ape, or roused bear of the smaller species—the prisoner, now left
      solitary, had jumped upon the ledge, to lose no glimpse of this departure.
      As he yet stood clasping the grate with both hands, an uproar broke upon
      his hearing; yells, shrieks, oaths, threats, execrations, all comprehended
      in it, though (as in a storm) nothing but a raging swell of sound
      distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excited into a still greater resemblance to a caged wild animal by his
      anxiety to know more, the prisoner leaped nimbly down, ran round the
      chamber, leaped nimbly up again, clasped the grate and tried to shake it,
      leaped down and ran, leaped up and listened, and never rested until the
      noise, becoming more and more distant, had died away. How many better
      prisoners have worn their noble hearts out so; no man thinking of it; not
      even the beloved of their souls realising it; great kings and governors,
      who had made them captive, careering in the sunlight jauntily, and men
      cheering them on. Even the said great personages dying in bed, making
      exemplary ends and sounding speeches; and polite history, more servile
      than their instruments, embalming them!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, John Baptist, now able to choose his own spot within the compass
      of those walls for the exercise of his faculty of going to sleep when he
      would, lay down upon the bench, with his face turned over on his crossed
      arms, and slumbered. In his submission, in his lightness, in his good
      humour, in his short-lived passion, in his easy contentment with hard
      bread and hard stones, in his ready sleep, in his fits and starts,
      altogether a true son of the land that gave him birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wide stare stared itself out for one while; the Sun went down in a
      red, green, golden glory; the stars came out in the heavens, and the
      fire-flies mimicked them in the lower air, as men may feebly imitate the
      goodness of a better order of beings; the long dusty roads and the
      interminable plains were in repose—and so deep a hush was on the
      sea, that it scarcely whispered of the time when it shall give up its
      dead.

      CHAPTER 2 Fellow Travellers
    </h2>
    <p>N
      o more of yesterday’s howling over yonder to-day, Sir; is there?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have heard none.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you may be sure there <i>is</i> none. When these people howl, they
      howl to be heard.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Most people do, I suppose.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! but these people are always howling. Never happy otherwise.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you mean the Marseilles people?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I mean the French people. They’re always at it. As to Marseilles, we know
      what Marseilles is. It sent the most insurrectionary tune into the world
      that was ever composed. It couldn’t exist without allonging and
      marshonging to something or other—victory or death, or blazes, or
      something.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker, with a whimsical good humour upon him all the time, looked
      over the parapet-wall with the greatest disparagement of Marseilles; and
      taking up a determined position by putting his hands in his pockets and
      rattling his money at it, apostrophised it with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Allong and marshong, indeed. It would be more creditable to you, I think,
      to let other people allong and marshong about their lawful business,
      instead of shutting ‘em up in quarantine!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tiresome enough,’ said the other. ‘But we shall be out to-day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Out to-day!’ repeated the first. ‘It’s almost an aggravation of the
      enormity, that we shall be out to-day. Out! What have we ever been in
      for?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For no very strong reason, I must say. But as we come from the East, and
      as the East is the country of the plague—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The plague!’ repeated the other. ‘That’s my grievance. I have had the
      plague continually, ever since I have been here. I am like a sane man shut
      up in a madhouse; I can’t stand the suspicion of the thing. I came here as
      well as ever I was in my life; but to suspect me of the plague is to give
      me the plague. And I have had it—and I have got it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You bear it very well, Mr Meagles,’ said the second speaker, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. If you knew the real state of the case, that’s the last observation
      you would think of making. I have been waking up night after night, and
      saying, <i>now</i> I have got it, <i>now</i> it has developed itself, <i>now</i>
      I am in for it, <i>now</i> these fellows are making out their case for
      their precautions. Why, I’d as soon have a spit put through me, and be
      stuck upon a card in a collection of beetles, as lead the life I have been
      leading here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Mr Meagles, say no more about it now it’s over,’ urged a cheerful
      feminine voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Over!’ repeated Mr Meagles, who appeared (though without any ill-nature)
      to be in that peculiar state of mind in which the last word spoken by
      anybody else is a new injury. ‘Over! and why should I say no more about it
      because it’s over?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mrs Meagles who had spoken to Mr Meagles; and Mrs Meagles was, like
      Mr Meagles, comely and healthy, with a pleasant English face which had
      been looking at homely things for five-and-fifty years or more, and shone
      with a bright reflection of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There! Never mind, Father, never mind!’ said Mrs Meagles. ‘For goodness
      sake content yourself with Pet.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘With Pet?’ repeated Mr Meagles in his injured vein. Pet, however, being
      close behind him, touched him on the shoulder, and Mr Meagles immediately
      forgave Marseilles from the bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pet was about twenty. A fair girl with rich brown hair hanging free in
      natural ringlets. A lovely girl, with a frank face, and wonderful eyes; so
      large, so soft, so bright, set to such perfection in her kind good head.
      She was round and fresh and dimpled and spoilt, and there was in Pet an
      air of timidity and dependence which was the best weakness in the world,
      and gave her the only crowning charm a girl so pretty and pleasant could
      have been without.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, I ask you,’ said Mr Meagles in the blandest confidence, falling back
      a step himself, and handing his daughter a step forward to illustrate his
      question: ‘I ask you simply, as between man and man, you know, DID you
      ever hear of such damned nonsense as putting Pet in quarantine?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It has had the result of making even quarantine enjoyable.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come!’ said Mr Meagles, ‘that’s something to be sure. I am obliged to you
      for that remark. Now, Pet, my darling, you had better go along with Mother
      and get ready for the boat. The officer of health, and a variety of
      humbugs in cocked hats, are coming off to let us out of this at last: and
      all we jail-birds are to breakfast together in something approaching to a
      Christian style again, before we take wing for our different destinations.
      Tattycoram, stick you close to your young mistress.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to a handsome girl with lustrous dark hair and eyes, and very
      neatly dressed, who replied with a half curtsey as she passed off in the
      train of Mrs Meagles and Pet. They crossed the bare scorched terrace all
      three together, and disappeared through a staring white archway. Mr
      Meagles’s companion, a grave dark man of forty, still stood looking
      towards this archway after they were gone; until Mr Meagles tapped him on
      the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon,’ said he, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all,’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took one silent turn backward and forward in the shade of the wall,
      getting, at the height on which the quarantine barracks are placed, what
      cool refreshment of sea breeze there was at seven in the morning. Mr
      Meagles’s companion resumed the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I ask you,’ he said, ‘what is the name of—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tattycoram?’ Mr Meagles struck in. ‘I have not the least idea.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought,’ said the other, ‘that—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tattycoram?’ suggested Mr Meagles again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you—that Tattycoram was a name; and I have several times
      wondered at the oddity of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, the fact is,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘Mrs Meagles and myself are, you see,
      practical people.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That you have frequently mentioned in the course of the agreeable and
      interesting conversations we have had together, walking up and down on
      these stones,’ said the other, with a half smile breaking through the
      gravity of his dark face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Practical people. So one day, five or six years ago now, when we took Pet
      to church at the Foundling—you have heard of the Foundling Hospital
      in London? Similar to the Institution for the Found Children in Paris?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have seen it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well! One day when we took Pet to church there to hear the music—because,
      as practical people, it is the business of our lives to show her
      everything that we think can please her—Mother (my usual name for
      Mrs Meagles) began to cry so, that it was necessary to take her out.
      “What’s the matter, Mother?” said I, when we had brought her a little
      round: “you are frightening Pet, my dear.” “Yes, I know that, Father,”
       says Mother, “but I think it’s through my loving her so much, that it ever
      came into my head.” “That ever what came into your head, Mother?” “O dear,
      dear!” cried Mother, breaking out again, “when I saw all those children
      ranged tier above tier, and appealing from the father none of them has
      ever known on earth, to the great Father of us all in Heaven, I thought,
      does any wretched mother ever come here, and look among those young faces,
      wondering which is the poor child she brought into this forlorn world,
      never through all its life to know her love, her kiss, her face, her
      voice, even her name!” Now that was practical in Mother, and I told her
      so. I said, “Mother, that’s what I call practical in you, my dear.”’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, not unmoved, assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So I said next day: Now, Mother, I have a proposition to make that I
      think you’ll approve of. Let us take one of those same little children to
      be a little maid to Pet. We are practical people. So if we should find her
      temper a little defective, or any of her ways a little wide of ours, we
      shall know what we have to take into account. We shall know what an
      immense deduction must be made from all the influences and experiences
      that have formed us—no parents, no child-brother or sister, no
      individuality of home, no Glass Slipper, or Fairy Godmother. And that’s
      the way we came by Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And the name itself—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By George!’ said Mr Meagles, ‘I was forgetting the name itself. Why, she
      was called in the Institution, Harriet Beadle—an arbitrary name, of
      course. Now, Harriet we changed into Hattey, and then into Tatty, because,
      as practical people, we thought even a playful name might be a new thing
      to her, and might have a softening and affectionate kind of effect, don’t
      you see? As to Beadle, that I needn’t say was wholly out of the question.
      If there is anything that is not to be tolerated on any terms, anything
      that is a type of Jack-in-office insolence and absurdity, anything that
      represents in coats, waistcoats, and big sticks our English holding on by
      nonsense after every one has found it out, it is a beadle. You haven’t
      seen a beadle lately?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As an Englishman who has been more than twenty years in China, no.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then,’ said Mr Meagles, laying his forefinger on his companion’s breast
      with great animation, ‘don’t you see a beadle, now, if you can help it.
      Whenever I see a beadle in full fig, coming down a street on a Sunday at
      the head of a charity school, I am obliged to turn and run away, or I
      should hit him. The name of Beadle being out of the question, and the
      originator of the Institution for these poor foundlings having been a
      blessed creature of the name of Coram, we gave that name to Pet’s little
      maid. At one time she was Tatty, and at one time she was Coram, until we
      got into a way of mixing the two names together, and now she is always
      Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your daughter,’ said the other, when they had taken another silent turn
      to and fro, and, after standing for a moment at the wall glancing down at
      the sea, had resumed their walk, ‘is your only child, I know, Mr Meagles.
      May I ask you—in no impertinent curiosity, but because I have had so
      much pleasure in your society, may never in this labyrinth of a world
      exchange a quiet word with you again, and wish to preserve an accurate
      remembrance of you and yours—may I ask you, if I have not gathered
      from your good wife that you have had other children?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. No,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘Not exactly other children. One other child.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am afraid I have inadvertently touched upon a tender theme.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never mind,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘If I am grave about it, I am not at all
      sorrowful. It quiets me for a moment, but does not make me unhappy. Pet
      had a twin sister who died when we could just see her eyes—exactly
      like Pet’s—above the table, as she stood on tiptoe holding by it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! indeed, indeed!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, and being practical people, a result has gradually sprung up in the
      minds of Mrs Meagles and myself which perhaps you may—or perhaps you
      may not—understand. Pet and her baby sister were so exactly alike,
      and so completely one, that in our thoughts we have never been able to
      separate them since. It would be of no use to tell us that our dead child
      was a mere infant. We have changed that child according to the changes in
      the child spared to us and always with us. As Pet has grown, that child
      has grown; as Pet has become more sensible and womanly, her sister has
      become more sensible and womanly by just the same degrees. It would be as
      hard to convince me that if I was to pass into the other world to-morrow,
      I should not, through the mercy of God, be received there by a daughter,
      just like Pet, as to persuade me that Pet herself is not a reality at my
      side.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I understand you,’ said the other, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to her,’ pursued her father, ‘the sudden loss of her little picture
      and playfellow, and her early association with that mystery in which we
      all have our equal share, but which is not often so forcibly presented to
      a child, has necessarily had some influence on her character. Then, her
      mother and I were not young when we married, and Pet has always had a sort
      of grown-up life with us, though we have tried to adapt ourselves to her.
      We have been advised more than once when she has been a little ailing, to
      change climate and air for her as often as we could—especially at
      about this time of her life—and to keep her amused. So, as I have no
      need to stick at a bank-desk now (though I have been poor enough in my
      time I assure you, or I should have married Mrs Meagles long before), we
      go trotting about the world. This is how you found us staring at the Nile,
      and the Pyramids, and the Sphinxes, and the Desert, and all the rest of
      it; and this is how Tattycoram will be a greater traveller in course of
      time than Captain Cook.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thank you,’ said the other, ‘very heartily for your confidence.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t mention it,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘I am sure you are quite welcome.
      And now, Mr Clennam, perhaps I may ask you whether you have yet come to a
      decision where to go next?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed, no. I am such a waif and stray everywhere, that I am liable to be
      drifted where any current may set.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s extraordinary to me—if you’ll excuse my freedom in saying so—that
      you don’t go straight to London,’ said Mr Meagles, in the tone of a
      confidential adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps I shall.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay! But I mean with a will.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have no will. That is to say,’—he coloured a little,—‘next
      to none that I can put in action now. Trained by main force; broken, not
      bent; heavily ironed with an object on which I was never consulted and
      which was never mine; shipped away to the other end of the world before I
      was of age, and exiled there until my father’s death there, a year ago;
      always grinding in a mill I always hated; what is to be expected from me
      in middle life? Will, purpose, hope? All those lights were extinguished
      before I could sound the words.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Light ‘em up again!’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! Easily said. I am the son, Mr Meagles, of a hard father and mother. I
      am the only child of parents who weighed, measured, and priced everything;
      for whom what could not be weighed, measured, and priced, had no
      existence. Strict people as the phrase is, professors of a stern religion,
      their very religion was a gloomy sacrifice of tastes and sympathies that
      were never their own, offered up as a part of a bargain for the security
      of their possessions. Austere faces, inexorable discipline, penance in
      this world and terror in the next—nothing graceful or gentle
      anywhere, and the void in my cowed heart everywhere—this was my
      childhood, if I may so misuse the word as to apply it to such a beginning
      of life.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really though?’ said Mr Meagles, made very uncomfortable by the picture
      offered to his imagination. ‘That was a tough commencement. But come! You
      must now study, and profit by, all that lies beyond it, like a practical
      man.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If the people who are usually called practical, were practical in your
      direction—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, so they are!’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are they indeed?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I suppose so,’ returned Mr Meagles, thinking about it. ‘Eh? One can
      but <i>be</i> practical, and Mrs Meagles and myself are nothing else.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My unknown course is easier and more helpful than I had expected to find
      it, then,’ said Clennam, shaking his head with his grave smile. ‘Enough of
      me. Here is the boat.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was filled with the cocked hats to which Mr Meagles entertained a
      national objection; and the wearers of those cocked hats landed and came
      up the steps, and all the impounded travellers congregated together. There
      was then a mighty production of papers on the part of the cocked hats, and
      a calling over of names, and great work of signing, sealing, stamping,
      inking, and sanding, with exceedingly blurred, gritty, and undecipherable
      results. Finally, everything was done according to rule, and the
      travellers were at liberty to depart whithersoever they would.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made little account of stare and glare, in the new pleasure of
      recovering their freedom, but flitted across the harbour in gay boats, and
      reassembled at a great hotel, whence the sun was excluded by closed
      lattices, and where bare paved floors, lofty ceilings, and resounding
      corridors tempered the intense heat. There, a great table in a great room
      was soon profusely covered with a superb repast; and the quarantine
      quarters became bare indeed, remembered among dainty dishes, southern
      fruits, cooled wines, flowers from Genoa, snow from the mountain tops, and
      all the colours of the rainbow flashing in the mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I bear those monotonous walls no ill-will now,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘One
      always begins to forgive a place as soon as it’s left behind; I dare say a
      prisoner begins to relent towards his prison, after he is let out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were about thirty in company, and all talking; but necessarily in
      groups. Father and Mother Meagles sat with their daughter between them,
      the last three on one side of the table: on the opposite side sat Mr
      Clennam; a tall French gentleman with raven hair and beard, of a swart and
      terrible, not to say genteelly diabolical aspect, but who had shown
      himself the mildest of men; and a handsome young Englishwoman, travelling
      quite alone, who had a proud observant face, and had either withdrawn
      herself from the rest or been avoided by the rest—nobody, herself
      excepted perhaps, could have quite decided which. The rest of the party
      were of the usual materials: travellers on business, and travellers for
      pleasure; officers from India on leave; merchants in the Greek and Turkey
      trades; a clerical English husband in a meek strait-waistcoat, on a
      wedding trip with his young wife; a majestic English mama and papa, of the
      patrician order, with a family of three growing-up daughters, who were
      keeping a journal for the confusion of their fellow-creatures; and a deaf
      old English mother, tough in travel, with a very decidedly grown-up
      daughter indeed, which daughter went sketching about the universe in the
      expectation of ultimately toning herself off into the married state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reserved Englishwoman took up Mr Meagles in his last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you mean that a prisoner forgives his prison?’ said she, slowly and
      with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That was my speculation, Miss Wade. I don’t pretend to know positively
      how a prisoner might feel. I never was one before.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mademoiselle doubts,’ said the French gentleman in his own language,
      ‘it’s being so easy to forgive?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pet had to translate this passage to Mr Meagles, who never by any accident
      acquired any knowledge whatever of the language of any country into which
      he travelled. ‘Oh!’ said he. ‘Dear me! But that’s a pity, isn’t it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That I am not credulous?’ said Miss Wade.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not exactly that. Put it another way. That you can’t believe it easy to
      forgive.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My experience,’ she quietly returned, ‘has been correcting my belief in
      many respects, for some years. It is our natural progress, I have heard.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, well! But it’s not natural to bear malice, I hope?’ said Mr
      Meagles, cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I had been shut up in any place to pine and suffer, I should always
      hate that place and wish to burn it down, or raze it to the ground. I know
      no more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Strong, sir?’ said Mr Meagles to the Frenchman; it being another of his
      habits to address individuals of all nations in idiomatic English, with a
      perfect conviction that they were bound to understand it somehow. ‘Rather
      forcible in our fair friend, you’ll agree with me, I think?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The French gentleman courteously replied, ‘Plait-il?’ To which Mr Meagles
      returned with much satisfaction, ‘You are right. My opinion.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The breakfast beginning by-and-by to languish, Mr Meagles made the company
      a speech. It was short enough and sensible enough, considering that it was
      a speech at all, and hearty. It merely went to the effect that as they had
      all been thrown together by chance, and had all preserved a good
      understanding together, and were now about to disperse, and were not
      likely ever to find themselves all together again, what could they do
      better than bid farewell to one another, and give one another good-speed
      in a simultaneous glass of cool champagne all round the table? It was
      done, and with a general shaking of hands the assembly broke up for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solitary young lady all this time had said no more. She rose with the
      rest, and silently withdrew to a remote corner of the great room, where
      she sat herself on a couch in a window, seeming to watch the reflection of
      the water as it made a silver quivering on the bars of the lattice. She
      sat, turned away from the whole length of the apartment, as if she were
      lonely of her own haughty choice. And yet it would have been as difficult
      as ever to say, positively, whether she avoided the rest, or was avoided.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow in which she sat, falling like a gloomy veil across her
      forehead, accorded very well with the character of her beauty. One could
      hardly see the face, so still and scornful, set off by the arched dark
      eyebrows, and the folds of dark hair, without wondering what its
      expression would be if a change came over it. That it could soften or
      relent, appeared next to impossible. That it could deepen into anger or
      any extreme of defiance, and that it must change in that direction when it
      changed at all, would have been its peculiar impression upon most
      observers. It was dressed and trimmed into no ceremony of expression.
      Although not an open face, there was no pretence in it. ‘I am
      self-contained and self-reliant; your opinion is nothing to me; I have no
      interest in you, care nothing for you, and see and hear you with
      indifference’—this it said plainly. It said so in the proud eyes, in
      the lifted nostril, in the handsome but compressed and even cruel mouth.
      Cover either two of those channels of expression, and the third would have
      said so still. Mask them all, and the mere turn of the head would have
      shown an unsubduable nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pet had moved up to her (she had been the subject of remark among her
      family and Mr Clennam, who were now the only other occupants of the room),
      and was standing at her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you’—she turned her eyes, and Pet faltered—‘expecting any
      one to meet you here, Miss Wade?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I? No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father is sending to the Poste Restante. Shall he have the pleasure of
      directing the messenger to ask if there are any letters for you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thank him, but I know there can be none.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We are afraid,’ said Pet, sitting down beside her, shyly and half
      tenderly, ‘that you will feel quite deserted when we are all gone.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not,’ said Pet, apologetically and embarrassed by her eyes, ‘not, of
      course, that we are any company to you, or that we have been able to be
      so, or that we thought you wished it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have not intended to make it understood that I did wish it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. Of course. But—in short,’ said Pet, timidly touching her hand
      as it lay impassive on the sofa between them, ‘will you not allow Father
      to tender you any slight assistance or service? He will be very glad.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very glad,’ said Mr Meagles, coming forward with his wife and Clennam.
      ‘Anything short of speaking the language, I shall be delighted to
      undertake, I am sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am obliged to you,’ she returned, ‘but my arrangements are made, and I
      prefer to go my own way in my own manner.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>Do</i> you?’ said Mr Meagles to himself, as he surveyed her with a
      puzzled look. ‘Well! There’s character in that, too.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am not much used to the society of young ladies, and I am afraid I may
      not show my appreciation of it as others might. A pleasant journey to you.
      Good-bye!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She would not have put out her hand, it seemed, but that Mr Meagles put
      out his so straight before her that she could not pass it. She put hers in
      it, and it lay there just as it had lain upon the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good-bye!’ said Mr Meagles. ‘This is the last good-bye upon the list, for
      Mother and I have just said it to Mr Clennam here, and he only waits to
      say it to Pet. Good-bye! We may never meet again.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In our course through life we shall meet the people who are coming to
      meet <i>us</i>, from many strange places and by many strange roads,’ was
      the composed reply; ‘and what it is set to us to do to them, and what it
      is set to them to do to us, will all be done.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the manner of these words that jarred upon Pet’s
      ear. It implied that what was to be done was necessarily evil, and it
      caused her to say in a whisper, ‘O Father!’ and to shrink childishly, in
      her spoilt way, a little closer to him. This was not lost on the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your pretty daughter,’ she said, ‘starts to think of such things. Yet,’ 
      looking full upon her, ‘you may be sure that there are men and women
      already on their road, who have their business to do with <i>you</i>, and
      who will do it. Of a certainty they will do it. They may be coming
      hundreds, thousands, of miles over the sea there; they may be close at
      hand now; they may be coming, for anything you know or anything you can do
      to prevent it, from the vilest sweepings of this very town.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the coldest of farewells, and with a certain worn expression on her
      beauty that gave it, though scarcely yet in its prime, a wasted look, she
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there were many stairs and passages that she had to traverse in
      passing from that part of the spacious house to the chamber she had
      secured for her own occupation. When she had almost completed the journey,
      and was passing along the gallery in which her room was, she heard an
      angry sound of muttering and sobbing. A door stood open, and within she
      saw the attendant upon the girl she had just left; the maid with the
      curious name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, to look at this maid. A sullen, passionate girl! Her rich
      black hair was all about her face, her face was flushed and hot, and as
      she sobbed and raged, she plucked at her lips with an unsparing hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Selfish brutes!’ said the girl, sobbing and heaving between whiles. ‘Not
      caring what becomes of me! Leaving me here hungry and thirsty and tired,
      to starve, for anything they care! Beasts! Devils! Wretches!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My poor girl, what is the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up suddenly, with reddened eyes, and with her hands suspended,
      in the act of pinching her neck, freshly disfigured with great scarlet
      blots. ‘It’s nothing to you what’s the matter. It don’t signify to any
      one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O yes it does; I am sorry to see you so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are not sorry,’ said the girl. ‘You are glad. You know you are glad.
      I never was like this but twice over in the quarantine yonder; and both
      times you found me. I am afraid of you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Afraid of me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. You seem to come like my own anger, my own malice, my own—whatever
      it is—I don’t know what it is. But I am ill-used, I am ill-used, I
      am ill-used!’ Here the sobs and the tears, and the tearing hand, which had
      all been suspended together since the first surprise, went on together
      anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor stood looking at her with a strange attentive smile. It was
      wonderful to see the fury of the contest in the girl, and the bodily
      struggle she made as if she were rent by the Demons of old.

    <p>
      ‘I am younger than she is by two or three years, and yet it’s me that
      looks after her, as if I was old, and it’s she that’s always petted and
      called Baby! I detest the name. I hate her! They make a fool of her, they
      spoil her. She thinks of nothing but herself, she thinks no more of me
      than if I was a stock and a stone!’ So the girl went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must have patience.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I <i>won’t</i> have patience!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If they take much care of themselves, and little or none of you, you must
      not mind it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      I <i>will</i> mind it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush! Be more prudent. You forget your dependent position.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t care for that. I’ll run away. I’ll do some mischief. I won’t bear
      it; I can’t bear it; I shall die if I try to bear it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The observer stood with her hand upon her own bosom, looking at the girl,
      as one afflicted with a diseased part might curiously watch the dissection
      and exposition of an analogous case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl raged and battled with all the force of her youth and fulness of
      life, until by little and little her passionate exclamations trailed off
      into broken murmurs as if she were in pain. By corresponding degrees she
      sank into a chair, then upon her knees, then upon the ground beside the
      bed, drawing the coverlet with her, half to hide her shamed head and wet
      hair in it, and half, as it seemed, to embrace it, rather than have
      nothing to take to her repentant breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Go away from me, go away from me! When my temper comes upon me, I am mad.
      I know I might keep it off if I only tried hard enough, and sometimes I do
      try hard enough, and at other times I don’t and won’t. What have I said! I
      knew when I said it, it was all lies. They think I am being taken care of
      somewhere, and have all I want. They are nothing but good to me. I love
      them dearly; no people could ever be kinder to a thankless creature than
      they always are to me. Do, do go away, for I am afraid of you. I am afraid
      of myself when I feel my temper coming, and I am as much afraid of you. Go
      away from me, and let me pray and cry myself better!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed on; and again the wide stare stared itself out; and the hot
      night was on Marseilles; and through it the caravan of the morning, all
      dispersed, went their appointed ways. And thus ever by day and night,
      under the sun and under the stars, climbing the dusty hills and toiling
      along the weary plains, journeying by land and journeying by sea, coming
      and going so strangely, to meet and to act and react on one another, move
      all we restless travellers through the pilgrimage of life.

<p>It was a Sunday evening in London, gloomy, close, and stale. Maddening
      church bells of all degrees of dissonance, sharp and flat, cracked and
      clear, fast and slow, made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous. Melancholy
      streets, in a penitential garb of soot, steeped the souls of the people
      who were condemned to look at them out of windows, in dire despondency. In
      every thoroughfare, up almost every alley, and down almost every turning,
      some doleful bell was throbbing, jerking, tolling, as if the Plague were
      in the city and the dead-carts were going round. Everything was bolted and
      barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an overworked people.
      No pictures, no unfamiliar animals, no rare plants or flowers, no natural
      or artificial wonders of the ancient world—all <i>taboo</i> with
      that enlightened strictness, that the ugly South Sea gods in the British
      Museum might have supposed themselves at home again. Nothing to see but
      streets, streets, streets. Nothing to breathe but streets, streets,
      streets. Nothing to change the brooding mind, or raise it up. Nothing for
      the spent toiler to do, but to compare the monotony of his seventh day
      with the monotony of his six days, think what a weary life he led, and
      make the best of it—or the worst, according to the probabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such a happy time, so propitious to the interests of religion and
      morality, Mr Arthur Clennam, newly arrived from Marseilles by way of
      Dover, and by Dover coach the Blue-eyed Maid, sat in the window of a
      coffee-house on Ludgate Hill. Ten thousand responsible houses surrounded
      him, frowning as heavily on the streets they composed, as if they were
      every one inhabited by the ten young men of the Calender’s story, who
      blackened their faces and bemoaned their miseries every night. Fifty
      thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that
      fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night, would be
      corrupt on Sunday morning; albeit my lord, their county member, was amazed
      that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher’s meat. Miles of
      close wells and pits of houses, where the inhabitants gasped for air,
      stretched far away towards every point of the compass. Through the heart
      of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed, in the place of a fine fresh
      river. What secular want could the million or so of human beings whose
      daily labour, six days in the week, lay among these Arcadian objects, from
      the sweet sameness of which they had no escape between the cradle and the
      grave—what secular want could they possibly have upon their seventh
      day? Clearly they could want nothing but a stringent policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arthur Clennam sat in the window of the coffee-house on Ludgate Hill,
      counting one of the neighbouring bells, making sentences and burdens of
      songs out of it in spite of himself, and wondering how many sick people it
      might be the death of in the course of the year. As the hour approached,
      its changes of measure made it more and more exasperating. At the quarter,
      it went off into a condition of deadly-lively importunity, urging the
      populace in a voluble manner to Come to church, Come to church, Come to
      church! At the ten minutes, it became aware that the congregation would be
      scanty, and slowly hammered out in low spirits, They <i>won’t</i> come,
      they <i>won’t</i> come, they <i>won’t</i> come! At the five minutes, it
      abandoned hope, and shook every house in the neighbourhood for three
      hundred seconds, with one dismal swing per second, as a groan of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank Heaven!’ said Clennam, when the hour struck, and the bell stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      But its sound had revived a long train of miserable Sundays, and the
      procession would not stop with the bell, but continued to march on.
      ‘Heaven forgive me,’ said he, ‘and those who trained me. How I have hated
      this day!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the dreary Sunday of his childhood, when he sat with his hands
      before him, scared out of his senses by a horrible tract which commenced
      business with the poor child by asking him in its title, why he was going
      to Perdition?—a piece of curiosity that he really, in a frock and
      drawers, was not in a condition to satisfy—and which, for the
      further attraction of his infant mind, had a parenthesis in every other
      line with some such hiccupping reference as 2 Ep. Thess. c. iii, v. 6
      &amp; 7. There was the sleepy Sunday of his boyhood, when, like a military
      deserter, he was marched to chapel by a picquet of teachers three times a
      day, morally handcuffed to another boy; and when he would willingly have
      bartered two meals of indigestible sermon for another ounce or two of
      inferior mutton at his scanty dinner in the flesh. There was the
      interminable Sunday of his nonage; when his mother, stern of face and
      unrelenting of heart, would sit all day behind a Bible—bound, like
      her own construction of it, in the hardest, barest, and straitest boards,
      with one dinted ornament on the cover like the drag of a chain, and a
      wrathful sprinkling of red upon the edges of the leaves—as if it, of
      all books! were a fortification against sweetness of temper, natural
      affection, and gentle intercourse. There was the resentful Sunday of a
      little later, when he sat down glowering and glooming through the tardy
      length of the day, with a sullen sense of injury in his heart, and no more
      real knowledge of the beneficent history of the New Testament than if he
      had been bred among idolaters. There was a legion of Sundays, all days of
      unserviceable bitterness and mortification, slowly passing before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Beg pardon, sir,’ said a brisk waiter, rubbing the table. ‘Wish see
      bed-room?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. I have just made up my mind to do it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Chaymaid!’ cried the waiter. ‘Gelen box num seven wish see room!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay!’ said Clennam, rousing himself. ‘I was not thinking of what I said;
      I answered mechanically. I am not going to sleep here. I am going home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Deed, sir? Chaymaid! Gelen box num seven, not go sleep here, gome.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat in the same place as the day died, looking at the dull houses
      opposite, and thinking, if the disembodied spirits of former inhabitants
      were ever conscious of them, how they must pity themselves for their old
      places of imprisonment. Sometimes a face would appear behind the dingy
      glass of a window, and would fade away into the gloom as if it had seen
      enough of life and had vanished out of it. Presently the rain began to
      fall in slanting lines between him and those houses, and people began to
      collect under cover of the public passage opposite, and to look out
      hopelessly at the sky as the rain dropped thicker and faster. Then wet
      umbrellas began to appear, draggled skirts, and mud. What the mud had been
      doing with itself, or where it came from, who could say? But it seemed to
      collect in a moment, as a crowd will, and in five minutes to have splashed
      all the sons and daughters of Adam. The lamplighter was going his rounds
      now; and as the fiery jets sprang up under his touch, one might have
      fancied them astonished at being suffered to introduce any show of
      brightness into such a dismal scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arthur Clennam took up his hat and buttoned his coat, and walked out.
      In the country, the rain would have developed a thousand fresh scents, and
      every drop would have had its bright association with some beautiful form
      of growth or life. In the city, it developed only foul stale smells, and
      was a sickly, lukewarm, dirt-stained, wretched addition to the gutters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed by St Paul’s and went down, at a long angle, almost to the
      water’s edge, through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie
      (and lay more crookedly and closely then) between the river and Cheapside.
      Passing, now the mouldy hall of some obsolete Worshipful Company, now the
      illuminated windows of a Congregationless Church that seemed to be waiting
      for some adventurous Belzoni to dig it out and discover its history;
      passing silent warehouses and wharves, and here and there a narrow alley
      leading to the river, where a wretched little bill, FOUND DROWNED, was
      weeping on the wet wall; he came at last to the house he sought. An old
      brick house, so dingy as to be all but black, standing by itself within a
      gateway. Before it, a square court-yard where a shrub or two and a patch
      of grass were as rank (which is saying much) as the iron railings
      enclosing them were rusty; behind it, a jumble of roots. It was a double
      house, with long, narrow, heavily-framed windows. Many years ago, it had
      had it in its mind to slide down sideways; it had been propped up,
      however, and was leaning on some half-dozen gigantic crutches: which
      gymnasium for the neighbouring cats, weather-stained, smoke-blackened, and
      overgrown with weeds, appeared in these latter days to be no very sure
      reliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing changed,’ said the traveller, stopping to look round. ‘Dark and
      miserable as ever. A light in my mother’s window, which seems never to
      have been extinguished since I came home twice a year from school, and
      dragged my box over this pavement. Well, well, well!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up to the door, which had a projecting canopy in carved work of
      festooned jack-towels and children’s heads with water on the brain,
      designed after a once-popular monumental pattern, and knocked. A shuffling
      step was soon heard on the stone floor of the hall, and the door was
      opened by an old man, bent and dried, but with keen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a candle in his hand, and he held it up for a moment to assist his
      keen eyes. ‘Ah, Mr Arthur?’ he said, without any emotion, ‘you are come at
      last? Step in.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Arthur stepped in and shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your figure is filled out, and set,’ said the old man, turning to look at
      him with the light raised again, and shaking his head; ‘but you don’t come
      up to your father in my opinion. Nor yet your mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How is my mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is as she always is now. Keeps her room when not actually bedridden,
      and hasn’t been out of it fifteen times in as many years, Arthur.’ They
      had walked into a spare, meagre dining-room. The old man had put the
      candlestick upon the table, and, supporting his right elbow with his left
      hand, was smoothing his leathern jaws while he looked at the visitor. The
      visitor offered his hand. The old man took it coldly enough, and seemed to
      prefer his jaws, to which he returned as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I doubt if your mother will approve of your coming home on the Sabbath,
      Arthur,’ he said, shaking his head warily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You wouldn’t have me go away again?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! I? I? I am not the master. It’s not what <i>I</i> would have. I have
      stood between your father and mother for a number of years. I don’t
      pretend to stand between your mother and you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you tell her that I have come home?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Arthur, yes. Oh, to be sure! I’ll tell her that you have come home.
      Please to wait here. You won’t find the room changed.’ He took another
      candle from a cupboard, lighted it, left the first on the table, and went
      upon his errand. He was a short, bald old man, in a high-shouldered black
      coat and waistcoat, drab breeches, and long drab gaiters. He might, from
      his dress, have been either clerk or servant, and in fact had long been
      both. There was nothing about him in the way of decoration but a watch,
      which was lowered into the depths of its proper pocket by an old black
      ribbon, and had a tarnished copper key moored above it, to show where it
      was sunk. His head was awry, and he had a one-sided, crab-like way with
      him, as if his foundations had yielded at about the same time as those of
      the house, and he ought to have been propped up in a similar manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How weak am I,’ said Arthur Clennam, when he was gone, ‘that I could shed
      tears at this reception! I, who have never experienced anything else; who
      have never expected anything else.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He not only could, but did. It was the momentary yielding of a nature that
      had been disappointed from the dawn of its perceptions, but had not quite
      given up all its hopeful yearnings yet. He subdued it, took up the candle,
      and examined the room. The old articles of furniture were in their old
      places; the Plagues of Egypt, much the dimmer for the fly and smoke
      plagues of London, were framed and glazed upon the walls. There was the
      old cellaret with nothing in it, lined with lead, like a sort of coffin in
      compartments; there was the old dark closet, also with nothing in it, of
      which he had been many a time the sole contents, in days of punishment,
      when he had regarded it as the veritable entrance to that bourne to which
      the tract had found him galloping. There was the large, hard-featured
      clock on the sideboard, which he used to see bending its figured brows
      upon him with a savage joy when he was behind-hand with his lessons, and
      which, when it was wound up once a week with an iron handle, used to sound
      as if it were growling in ferocious anticipation of the miseries into
      which it would bring him. But here was the old man come back, saying,
      ‘Arthur, I’ll go before and light you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur followed him up the staircase, which was panelled off into spaces
      like so many mourning tablets, into a dim bed-chamber, the floor of which
      had gradually so sunk and settled, that the fire-place was in a dell. On a
      black bier-like sofa in this hollow, propped up behind with one great
      angular black bolster like the block at a state execution in the good old
      times, sat his mother in a widow’s dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and his father had been at variance from his earliest remembrance. To
      sit speechless himself in the midst of rigid silence, glancing in dread
      from the one averted face to the other, had been the peacefullest
      occupation of his childhood. She gave him one glassy kiss, and four stiff
      fingers muffled in worsted. This embrace concluded, he sat down on the
      opposite side of her little table. There was a fire in the grate, as there
      had been night and day for fifteen years. There was a kettle on the hob,
      as there had been night and day for fifteen years. There was a little
      mound of damped ashes on the top of the fire, and another little mound
      swept together under the grate, as there had been night and day for
      fifteen years. There was a smell of black dye in the airless room, which
      the fire had been drawing out of the crape and stuff of the widow’s dress
      for fifteen months, and out of the bier-like sofa for fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mother, this is a change from your old active habits.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The world has narrowed to these dimensions, Arthur,’ she replied,
      glancing round the room. ‘It is well for me that I never set my heart upon
      its hollow vanities.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old influence of her presence and her stern strong voice, so gathered
      about her son, that he felt conscious of a renewal of the timid chill and
      reserve of his childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you never leave your room, mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What with my rheumatic affection, and what with its attendant debility or
      nervous weakness—names are of no matter now—I have lost the
      use of my limbs. I never leave my room. I have not been outside this door
      for—tell him for how long,’ she said, speaking over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A dozen year next Christmas,’ returned a cracked voice out of the dimness
      behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is that Affery?’ said Arthur, looking towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cracked voice replied that it was Affery: and an old woman came
      forward into what doubtful light there was, and kissed her hand once; then
      subsided again into the dimness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am able,’ said Mrs Clennam, with a slight motion of her worsted-muffled
      right hand toward a chair on wheels, standing before a tall writing
      cabinet close shut up, ‘I am able to attend to my business duties, and I
      am thankful for the privilege. It is a great privilege. But no more of
      business on this day. It is a bad night, is it not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does it snow?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Snow, mother? And we only yet in September?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All seasons are alike to me,’ she returned, with a grim kind of
      luxuriousness. ‘I know nothing of summer and winter, shut up here. The
      Lord has been pleased to put me beyond all that.’ With her cold grey eyes
      and her cold grey hair, and her immovable face, as stiff as the folds of
      her stony head-dress,—her being beyond the reach of the seasons
      seemed but a fit sequence to her being beyond the reach of all changing
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her little table lay two or three books, her handkerchief, a pair of
      steel spectacles newly taken off, and an old-fashioned gold watch in a
      heavy double case. Upon this last object her son’s eyes and her own now
      rested together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I see that you received the packet I sent you on my father’s death,
      safely, mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I never knew my father to show so much anxiety on any subject, as that
      his watch should be sent straight to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I keep it here as a remembrance of your father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was not until the last, that he expressed the wish; when he could only
      put his hand upon it, and very indistinctly say to me “your mother.” A
      moment before, I thought him wandering in his mind, as he had been for
      many hours—I think he had no consciousness of pain in his short
      illness—when I saw him turn himself in his bed and try to open it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Was your father, then, not wandering in his mind when he tried to open
      it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. He was quite sensible at that time.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam shook her head; whether in dismissal of the deceased or
      opposing herself to her son’s opinion, was not clearly expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘After my father’s death I opened it myself, thinking there might be, for
      anything I knew, some memorandum there. However, as I need not tell you,
      mother, there was nothing but the old silk watch-paper worked in beads,
      which you found (no doubt) in its place between the cases, where I found
      and left it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam signified assent; then added, ‘No more of business on this
      day,’ and then added, ‘Affery, it is nine o’clock.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, the old woman cleared the little table, went out of the room,
      and quickly returned with a tray on which was a dish of little rusks and a
      small precise pat of butter, cool, symmetrical, white, and plump. The old
      man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole
      interview, looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son
      down-stairs, went out at the same time, and, after a longer absence,
      returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of
      port wine (which, to judge by his panting, he had brought from the
      cellar), a lemon, a sugar-basin, and a spice box. With these materials and
      the aid of the kettle, he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture,
      measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician’s
      prescription. Into this mixture Mrs Clennam dipped certain of the rusks,
      and ate them; while the old woman buttered certain other of the rusks,
      which were to be eaten alone. When the invalid had eaten all the rusks and
      drunk all the mixture, the two trays were removed; and the books and the
      candle, watch, handkerchief, and spectacles were replaced upon the table.
      She then put on the spectacles and read certain passages aloud from a book—sternly,
      fiercely, wrathfully—praying that her enemies (she made them by her
      tone and manner expressly hers) might be put to the edge of the sword,
      consumed by fire, smitten by plagues and leprosy, that their bones might
      be ground to dust, and that they might be utterly exterminated. As she
      read on, years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a
      dream, and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep
      of an innocent child to overshadow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shut the book and remained for a little time with her face shaded by
      her hand. So did the old man, otherwise still unchanged in attitude; so,
      probably, did the old woman in her dimmer part of the room. Then the sick
      woman was ready for bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good night, Arthur. Affery will see to your accommodation. Only touch me,
      for my hand is tender.’ He touched the worsted muffling of her hand—that
      was nothing; if his mother had been sheathed in brass there would have
      been no new barrier between them—and followed the old man and woman
      down-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter asked him, when they were alone together among the heavy
      shadows of the dining-room, would he have some supper?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, Affery, no supper.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You shall if you like,’ said Affery. ‘There’s her tomorrow’s partridge in
      the larder—her first this year; say the word and I’ll cook it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he had not long dined, and could eat nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have something to drink, then,’ said Affery; ‘you shall have some of her
      bottle of port, if you like. I’ll tell Jeremiah that you ordered me to
      bring it you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      No; nor would he have that, either.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s no reason, Arthur,’ said the old woman, bending over him to whisper,
      ‘that because I am afeared of my life of ‘em, you should be. You’ve got
      half the property, haven’t you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well then, don’t you be cowed. You’re clever, Arthur, an’t you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, as she seemed to expect an answer in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then stand up against them! She’s awful clever, and none but a clever one
      durst say a word to her. <i>He’s</i> a clever one—oh, he’s a clever
      one!—and he gives it her when he has a mind to’t, he does!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your husband does?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does? It makes me shake from head to foot, to hear him give it her. My
      husband, Jeremiah Flintwinch, can conquer even your mother. What can he be
      but a clever one to do that!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His shuffling footstep coming towards them caused her to retreat to the
      other end of the room. Though a tall, hard-favoured, sinewy old woman, who
      in her youth might have enlisted in the Foot Guards without much fear of
      discovery, she collapsed before the little keen-eyed crab-like old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, Affery,’ said he, ‘now, woman, what are you doing? Can’t you find
      Master Arthur something or another to pick at?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Arthur repeated his recent refusal to pick at anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well, then,’ said the old man; ‘make his bed. Stir yourself.’ His
      neck was so twisted that the knotted ends of his white cravat usually
      dangled under one ear; his natural acerbity and energy, always contending
      with a second nature of habitual repression, gave his features a swollen
      and suffused look; and altogether, he had a weird appearance of having
      hanged himself at one time or other, and of having gone about ever since,
      halter and all, exactly as some timely hand had cut him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’ll have bitter words together to-morrow, Arthur; you and your
      mother,’ said Jeremiah. ‘Your having given up the business on your
      father’s death—which she suspects, though we have left it to you to
      tell her—won’t go off smoothly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have given up everything in life for the business, and the time came
      for me to give up that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good!’ cried Jeremiah, evidently meaning Bad. ‘Very good! only don’t
      expect me to stand between your mother and you, Arthur. I stood between
      your mother and your father, fending off this, and fending off that, and
      getting crushed and pounded betwixt em; and I’ve done with such work.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You will never be asked to begin it again for me, Jeremiah.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good. I’m glad to hear it; because I should have had to decline it, if I
      had been. That’s enough—as your mother says—and more than
      enough of such matters on a Sabbath night. Affery, woman, have you found
      what you want yet?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been collecting sheets and blankets from a press, and hastened to
      gather them up, and to reply, ‘Yes, Jeremiah.’ Arthur Clennam helped her
      by carrying the load himself, wished the old man good night, and went
      up-stairs with her to the top of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted up and up, through the musty smell of an old close house,
      little used, to a large garret bed-room. Meagre and spare, like all the
      other rooms, it was even uglier and grimmer than the rest, by being the
      place of banishment for the worn-out furniture. Its movables were ugly old
      chairs with worn-out seats, and ugly old chairs without any seats; a
      threadbare patternless carpet, a maimed table, a crippled wardrobe, a lean
      set of fire-irons like the skeleton of a set deceased, a washing-stand
      that looked as if it had stood for ages in a hail of dirty soapsuds, and a
      bedstead with four bare atomies of posts, each terminating in a spike, as
      if for the dismal accommodation of lodgers who might prefer to impale
      themselves. Arthur opened the long low window, and looked out upon the old
      blasted and blackened forest of chimneys, and the old red glare in the
      sky, which had seemed to him once upon a time but a nightly reflection of
      the fiery environment that was presented to his childish fancy in all
      directions, let it look where it would.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew in his head again, sat down at the bedside, and looked on at
      Affery Flintwinch making the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Affery, you were not married when I went away.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She screwed her mouth into the form of saying ‘No,’ shook her head, and
      proceeded to get a pillow into its case.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How did it happen?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, Jeremiah, o’ course,’ said Affery, with an end of the pillow-case
      between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course he proposed it, but how did it all come about? I should have
      thought that neither of you would have married; least of all should I have
      thought of your marrying each other.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No more should I,’ said Mrs Flintwinch, tying the pillow tightly in its
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s what I mean. When did you begin to think otherwise?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never begun to think otherwise at all,’ said Mrs Flintwinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing, as she patted the pillow into its place on the bolster, that he
      was still looking at her as if waiting for the rest of her reply, she gave
      it a great poke in the middle, and asked, ‘How could I help myself?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How could you help yourself from being married!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O’ course,’ said Mrs Flintwinch. ‘It was no doing o’ mine. I’d never
      thought of it. I’d got something to do, without thinking, indeed! She kept
      me to it (as well as he) when she could go about, and she could go about
      then.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ echoed Mrs Flintwinch. ‘That’s what I said myself. Well! What’s
      the use of considering? If them two clever ones have made up their minds
      to it, what’s left for <i>me</i> to do? Nothing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Was it my mother’s project, then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Lord bless you, Arthur, and forgive me the wish!’ cried Affery,
      speaking always in a low tone. ‘If they hadn’t been both of a mind in it,
      how could it ever have been? Jeremiah never courted me; t’ant likely that
      he would, after living in the house with me and ordering me about for as
      many years as he’d done. He said to me one day, he said, “Affery,” he
      said, “now I am going to tell you something. What do you think of the name
      of Flintwinch?” “What do I think of it?” I says. “Yes,” he said, “because
      you’re going to take it,” he said. “Take it?” I says. “Jere-<i>mi</i>-ah?”
       Oh! he’s a clever one!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch went on to spread the upper sheet over the bed, and the
      blanket over that, and the counterpane over that, as if she had quite
      concluded her story.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ said Arthur again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ echoed Mrs Flintwinch again. ‘How could I help myself? He said to
      me, “Affery, you and me must be married, and I’ll tell you why. She’s
      failing in health, and she’ll want pretty constant attendance up in her
      room, and we shall have to be much with her, and there’ll be nobody about
      now but ourselves when we’re away from her, and altogether it will be more
      convenient. She’s of my opinion,” he said, “so if you’ll put your bonnet
      on next Monday morning at eight, we’ll get it over.”’ Mrs Flintwinch
      tucked up the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ repeated Mrs Flintwinch, ‘I think so! I sits me down and says it.
      Well!—Jeremiah then says to me, “As to banns, next Sunday being the
      third time of asking (for I’ve put ‘em up a fortnight), is my reason for
      naming Monday. She’ll speak to you about it herself, and now she’ll find
      you prepared, Affery.” That same day she spoke to me, and she said, “So,
      Affery, I understand that you and Jeremiah are going to be married. I am
      glad of it, and so are you, with reason. It is a very good thing for you,
      and very welcome under the circumstances to me. He is a sensible man, and
      a trustworthy man, and a persevering man, and a pious man.” What could I
      say when it had come to that? Why, if it had been—a smothering
      instead of a wedding,’ Mrs Flintwinch cast about in her mind with great
      pains for this form of expression, ‘I couldn’t have said a word upon it,
      against them two clever ones.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In good faith, I believe so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And so you may, Arthur.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Affery, what girl was that in my mother’s room just now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Girl?’ said Mrs Flintwinch in a rather sharp key.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was a girl, surely, whom I saw near you—almost hidden in the
      dark corner?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! She? Little Dorrit? <i>She</i>’s nothing; she’s a whim of—hers.’ 
      It was a peculiarity of Affery Flintwinch that she never spoke of Mrs
      Clennam by name. ‘But there’s another sort of girls than that about. Have
      you forgot your old sweetheart? Long and long ago, I’ll be bound.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I suffered enough from my mother’s separating us, to remember her. I
      recollect her very well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you got another?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here’s news for you, then. She’s well to do now, and a widow. And if you
      like to have her, why you can.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And how do you know that, Affery?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Them two clever ones have been speaking about it.—There’s Jeremiah
      on the stairs!’ She was gone in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch had introduced into the web that his mind was busily
      weaving, in that old workshop where the loom of his youth had stood, the
      last thread wanting to the pattern. The airy folly of a boy’s love had
      found its way even into that house, and he had been as wretched under its
      hopelessness as if the house had been a castle of romance. Little more
      than a week ago at Marseilles, the face of the pretty girl from whom he
      had parted with regret, had had an unusual interest for him, and a tender
      hold upon him, because of some resemblance, real or imagined, to this
      first face that had soared out of his gloomy life into the bright glories
      of fancy. He leaned upon the sill of the long low window, and looking out
      upon the blackened forest of chimneys again, began to dream; for it had
      been the uniform tendency of this man’s life—so much was wanting in
      it to think about, so much that might have been better directed and
      happier to speculate upon—to make him a dreamer, after all.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Mrs Flintwinch has a Dream</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, she usually dreamed, unlike the son of her
      old mistress, with her eyes shut. She had a curiously vivid dream that
      night, and before she had left the son of her old mistress many hours. In
      fact it was not at all like a dream; it was so very real in every respect.
      It happened in this wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed-chamber occupied by Mr and Mrs Flintwinch was within a few paces
      of that to which Mrs Clennam had been so long confined. It was not on the
      same floor, for it was a room at the side of the house, which was
      approached by a steep descent of a few odd steps, diverging from the main
      staircase nearly opposite to Mrs Clennam’s door. It could scarcely be said
      to be within call, the walls, doors, and panelling of the old place were
      so cumbrous; but it was within easy reach, in any undress, at any hour of
      the night, in any temperature. At the head of the bed and within a foot of
      Mrs Flintwinch’s ear, was a bell, the line of which hung ready to Mrs
      Clennam’s hand. Whenever this bell rang, up started Affery, and was in the
      sick room before she was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got her mistress into bed, lighted her lamp, and given her good
      night, Mrs Flintwinch went to roost as usual, saving that her lord had not
      yet appeared. It was her lord himself who became—unlike the last
      theme in the mind, according to the observation of most philosophers—the
      subject of Mrs Flintwinch’s dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours, and found
      Jeremiah not yet abed. That she looked at the candle she had left burning,
      and, measuring the time like King Alfred the Great, was confirmed by its
      wasted state in her belief that she had been asleep for some considerable
      period. That she arose thereupon, muffled herself up in a wrapper, put on
      her shoes, and went out on the staircase, much surprised, to look for
      Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      The staircase was as wooden and solid as need be, and Affery went straight
      down it without any of those deviations peculiar to dreams. She did not
      skim over it, but walked down it, and guided herself by the banisters on
      account of her candle having died out. In one corner of the hall, behind
      the house-door, there was a little waiting-room, like a well-shaft, with a
      long narrow window in it as if it had been ripped up. In this room, which
      was never used, a light was burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch crossed the hall, feeling its pavement cold to her
      stockingless feet, and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door,
      which stood a little open. She expected to see Jeremiah fast asleep or in
      a fit, but he was calmly seated in a chair, awake, and in his usual
      health. But what—hey?—Lord forgive us!—Mrs Flintwinch
      muttered some ejaculation to this effect, and turned giddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, Mr Flintwinch awake, was watching Mr Flintwinch asleep. He sat on one
      side of the small table, looking keenly at himself on the other side with
      his chin sunk on his breast, snoring. The waking Flintwinch had his full
      front face presented to his wife; the sleeping Flintwinch was in profile.
      The waking Flintwinch was the old original; the sleeping Flintwinch was
      the double, just as she might have distinguished between a tangible object
      and its reflection in a glass, Affery made out this difference with her
      head going round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had had any doubt which was her own Jeremiah, it would have been
      resolved by his impatience. He looked about him for an offensive weapon,
      caught up the snuffers, and, before applying them to the cabbage-headed
      candle, lunged at the sleeper as though he would have run him through the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who’s that? What’s the matter?’ cried the sleeper, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch made a movement with the snuffers, as if he would have
      enforced silence on his companion by putting them down his throat; the
      companion, coming to himself, said, rubbing his eyes, ‘I forgot where I
      was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have been asleep,’ snarled Jeremiah, referring to his watch, ‘two
      hours. You said you would be rested enough if you had a short nap.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have had a short nap,’ said Double.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Half-past two o’clock in the morning,’ muttered Jeremiah. ‘Where’s your
      hat? Where’s your coat? Where’s the box?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All here,’ said Double, tying up his throat with sleepy carefulness in a
      shawl. ‘Stop a minute. Now give me the sleeve—not that sleeve, the
      other one. Ha! I’m not as young as I was.’ Mr Flintwinch had pulled him
      into his coat with vehement energy. ‘You promised me a second glass after
      I was rested.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Drink it!’ returned Jeremiah, ‘and—choke yourself, I was going to
      say—but go, I mean.’ At the same time he produced the identical
      port-wine bottle, and filled a wine-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Her port-wine, I believe?’ said Double, tasting it as if he were in the
      Docks, with hours to spare. ‘Her health.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a sip.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your health!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took another sip.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘His health!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He took another sip.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And all friends round St Paul’s.’ He emptied and put down the wine-glass
      half-way through this ancient civic toast, and took up the box. It was an
      iron box some two feet square, which he carried under his arms pretty
      easily. Jeremiah watched his manner of adjusting it, with jealous eyes;
      tried it with his hands, to be sure that he had a firm hold of it; bade
      him for his life be careful what he was about; and then stole out on
      tiptoe to open the door for him. Affery, anticipating the last movement,
      was on the staircase. The sequence of things was so ordinary and natural,
      that, standing there, she could hear the door open, feel the night air,
      and see the stars outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now came the most remarkable part of the dream. She felt so afraid of
      her husband, that being on the staircase, she had not the power to retreat
      to her room (which she might easily have done before he had fastened the
      door), but stood there staring. Consequently when he came up the staircase
      to bed, candle in hand, he came full upon her. He looked astonished, but
      said not a word. He kept his eyes upon her, and kept advancing; and she,
      completely under his influence, kept retiring before him. Thus, she
      walking backward and he walking forward, they came into their own room.
      They were no sooner shut in there, than Mr Flintwinch took her by the
      throat, and shook her until she was black in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, Affery, woman—Affery!’ said Mr Flintwinch. ‘What have you been
      dreaming of? Wake up, wake up! What’s the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The—the matter, Jeremiah?’ gasped Mrs Flintwinch, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, Affery, woman—Affery! You have been getting out of bed in your
      sleep, my dear! I come up, after having fallen asleep myself, below, and
      find you in your wrapper here, with the nightmare. Affery, woman,’ said Mr
      Flintwinch, with a friendly grin on his expressive countenance, ‘if you
      ever have a dream of this sort again, it’ll be a sign of your being in
      want of physic. And I’ll give you such a dose, old woman—such a
      dose!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch thanked him and crept into bed.
    </p>

	</hgroup>
<p>As the city clocks struck nine on Monday morning, Mrs Clennam was wheeled
      by Jeremiah Flintwinch of the cut-down aspect to her tall cabinet. When
      she had unlocked and opened it, and had settled herself at its desk,
      Jeremiah withdrew—as it might be, to hang himself more effectually—and
      her son appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you any better this morning, mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, with the same austere air of luxuriousness that she
      had shown over-night when speaking of the weather. ‘I shall never be
      better any more. It is well for me, Arthur, that I know it and can bear
      it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting with her hands laid separately upon the desk, and the tall cabinet
      towering before her, she looked as if she were performing on a dumb church
      organ. Her son thought so (it was an old thought with him), while he took
      his seat beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened a drawer or two, looked over some business papers, and put them
      back again. Her severe face had no thread of relaxation in it, by which
      any explorer could have been guided to the gloomy labyrinth of her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Shall I speak of our affairs, mother? Are you inclined to enter upon
      business?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Am I inclined, Arthur? Rather, are you? Your father has been dead a year
      and more. I have been at your disposal, and waiting your pleasure, ever
      since.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There was much to arrange before I could leave; and when I did leave, I
      travelled a little for rest and relief.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face towards him, as not having heard or understood his
      last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For rest and relief.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced round the sombre room, and appeared from the motion of her
      lips to repeat the words to herself, as calling it to witness how little
      of either it afforded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Besides, mother, you being sole executrix, and having the direction and
      management of the estate, there remained little business, or I might say
      none, that I could transact, until you had had time to arrange matters to
      your satisfaction.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The accounts are made out,’ she returned. ‘I have them here. The vouchers
      have all been examined and passed. You can inspect them when you like,
      Arthur; now, if you please.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is quite enough, mother, to know that the business is completed. Shall
      I proceed then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not?’ she said, in her frozen way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mother, our House has done less and less for some years past, and our
      dealings have been progressively on the decline. We have never shown much
      confidence, or invited much; we have attached no people to us; the track
      we have kept is not the track of the time; and we have been left far
      behind. I need not dwell on this to you, mother. You know it necessarily.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know what you mean,’ she answered, in a qualified tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Even this old house in which we speak,’ pursued her son, ‘is an instance
      of what I say. In my father’s earlier time, and in his uncle’s time before
      him, it was a place of business—really a place of business, and
      business resort. Now, it is a mere anomaly and incongruity here, out of
      date and out of purpose. All our consignments have long been made to
      Rovinghams’ the commission-merchants; and although, as a check upon them,
      and in the stewardship of my father’s resources, your judgment and
      watchfulness have been actively exerted, still those qualities would have
      influenced my father’s fortunes equally, if you had lived in any private
      dwelling: would they not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you consider,’ she returned, without answering his question, ‘that a
      house serves no purpose, Arthur, in sheltering your infirm and afflicted—justly
      infirm and righteously afflicted—mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was speaking only of business purposes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘With what object?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am coming to it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I foresee,’ she returned, fixing her eyes upon him, ‘what it is. But the
      Lord forbid that I should repine under any visitation. In my sinfulness I
      merit bitter disappointment, and I accept it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mother, I grieve to hear you speak like this, though I have had my
      apprehensions that you would—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You knew I would. You knew <i>me</i>,’ she interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son paused for a moment. He had struck fire out of her, and was
      surprised. ‘Well!’ she said, relapsing into stone. ‘Go on. Let me hear.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have anticipated, mother, that I decide for my part, to abandon the
      business. I have done with it. I will not take upon myself to advise you;
      you will continue it, I see. If I had any influence with you, I would
      simply use it to soften your judgment of me in causing you this
      disappointment: to represent to you that I have lived the half of a long
      term of life, and have never before set my own will against yours. I
      cannot say that I have been able to conform myself, in heart and spirit,
      to your rules; I cannot say that I believe my forty years have been
      profitable or pleasant to myself, or any one; but I have habitually
      submitted, and I only ask you to remember it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Woe to the suppliant, if such a one there were or ever had been, who had
      any concession to look for in the inexorable face at the cabinet. Woe to
      the defaulter whose appeal lay to the tribunal where those severe eyes
      presided. Great need had the rigid woman of her mystical religion, veiled
      in gloom and darkness, with lightnings of cursing, vengeance, and
      destruction, flashing through the sable clouds. Forgive us our debts as we
      forgive our debtors, was a prayer too poor in spirit for her. Smite Thou
      my debtors, Lord, wither them, crush them; do Thou as I would do, and Thou
      shalt have my worship: this was the impious tower of stone she built up to
      scale Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you finished, Arthur, or have you anything more to say to me? I
      think there can be nothing else. You have been short, but full of matter!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mother, I have yet something more to say. It has been upon my mind, night
      and day, this long time. It is far more difficult to say than what I have
      said. That concerned myself; this concerns us all.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Us all! Who are us all?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yourself, myself, my dead father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her hands from the desk; folded them in her lap; and sat looking
      towards the fire, with the impenetrability of an old Egyptian sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You knew my father infinitely better than I ever knew him; and his
      reserve with me yielded to you. You were much the stronger, mother, and
      directed him. As a child, I knew it as well as I know it now. I knew that
      your ascendancy over him was the cause of his going to China to take care
      of the business there, while you took care of it here (though I do not
      even now know whether these were really terms of separation that you
      agreed upon); and that it was your will that I should remain with you
      until I was twenty, and then go to him as I did. You will not be offended
      by my recalling this, after twenty years?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am waiting to hear why you recall it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered his voice, and said, with manifest reluctance, and against his
      will:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to ask you, mother, whether it ever occurred to you to suspect—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the word Suspect, she turned her eyes momentarily upon her son, with a
      dark frown. She then suffered them to seek the fire, as before; but with
      the frown fixed above them, as if the sculptor of old Egypt had indented
      it in the hard granite face, to frown for ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—that he had any secret remembrance which caused him trouble of
      mind—remorse? Whether you ever observed anything in his conduct
      suggesting that; or ever spoke to him upon it, or ever heard him hint at
      such a thing?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do not understand what kind of secret remembrance you mean to infer
      that your father was a prey to,’ she returned, after a silence. ‘You speak
      so mysteriously.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it possible, mother,’ her son leaned forward to be the nearer to her
      while he whispered it, and laid his hand nervously upon her desk, ‘is it
      possible, mother, that he had unhappily wronged any one, and made no
      reparation?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at him wrathfully, she bent herself back in her chair to keep him
      further off, but gave him no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am deeply sensible, mother, that if this thought has never at any time
      flashed upon you, it must seem cruel and unnatural in me, even in this
      confidence, to breathe it. But I cannot shake it off. Time and change (I
      have tried both before breaking silence) do nothing to wear it out.
      Remember, I was with my father. Remember, I saw his face when he gave the
      watch into my keeping, and struggled to express that he sent it as a token
      you would understand, to you. Remember, I saw him at the last with the
      pencil in his failing hand, trying to write some word for you to read, but
      to which he could give no shape. The more remote and cruel this vague
      suspicion that I have, the stronger the circumstances that could give it
      any semblance of probability to me. For Heaven’s sake, let us examine
      sacredly whether there is any wrong entrusted to us to set right. No one
      can help towards it, mother, but you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still so recoiling in her chair that her overpoised weight moved it, from
      time to time, a little on its wheels, and gave her the appearance of a
      phantom of fierce aspect gliding away from him, she interposed her left
      arm, bent at the elbow with the back of her hand towards her face, between
      herself and him, and looked at him in a fixed silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In grasping at money and in driving hard bargains—I have begun, and
      I must speak of such things now, mother—some one may have been
      grievously deceived, injured, ruined. You were the moving power of all
      this machinery before my birth; your stronger spirit has been infused into
      all my father’s dealings for more than two score years. You can set these
      doubts at rest, I think, if you will really help me to discover the truth.
      Will you, mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in the hope that she would speak. But her grey hair was not
      more immovable in its two folds, than were her firm lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If reparation can be made to any one, if restitution can be made to any
      one, let us know it and make it. Nay, mother, if within my means, let <i>me</i>
      make it. I have seen so little happiness come of money; it has brought
      within my knowledge so little peace to this house, or to any one belonging
      to it, that it is worth less to me than to another. It can buy me nothing
      that will not be a reproach and misery to me, if I am haunted by a
      suspicion that it darkened my father’s last hours with remorse, and that
      it is not honestly and justly mine.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bell-rope hanging on the panelled wall, some two or three
      yards from the cabinet. By a swift and sudden action of her foot, she
      drove her wheeled chair rapidly back to it and pulled it violently—still
      holding her arm up in its shield-like posture, as if he were striking at
      her, and she warding off the blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl came hurrying in, frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Send Flintwinch here!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the girl had withdrawn, and the old man stood within the door.
      ‘What! You’re hammer and tongs, already, you two?’ he said, coolly
      stroking his face. ‘I thought you would be. I was pretty sure of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flintwinch!’ said the mother, ‘look at my son. Look at him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I <i>am</i> looking at him,’ said Flintwinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out the arm with which she had shielded herself, and as she
      went on, pointed at the object of her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In the very hour of his return almost—before the shoe upon his foot
      is dry—he asperses his father’s memory to his mother! Asks his
      mother to become, with him, a spy upon his father’s transactions through a
      lifetime! Has misgivings that the goods of this world which we have
      painfully got together early and late, with wear and tear and toil and
      self-denial, are so much plunder; and asks to whom they shall be given up,
      as reparation and restitution!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she said this raging, she said it in a voice so far from being
      beyond her control that it was even lower than her usual tone. She also
      spoke with great distinctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Reparation!’ said she. ‘Yes, truly! It is easy for him to talk of
      reparation, fresh from journeying and junketing in foreign lands, and
      living a life of vanity and pleasure. But let him look at me, in prison,
      and in bonds here. I endure without murmuring, because it is appointed
      that I shall so make reparation for my sins. Reparation! Is there none in
      this room? Has there been none here this fifteen years?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was she always balancing her bargains with the Majesty of heaven,
      posting up the entries to her credit, strictly keeping her set-off, and
      claiming her due. She was only remarkable in this, for the force and
      emphasis with which she did it. Thousands upon thousands do it, according
      to their varying manner, every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flintwinch, give me that book!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man handed it to her from the table. She put two fingers between
      the leaves, closed the book upon them, and held it up to her son in a
      threatening way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In the days of old, Arthur, treated of in this commentary, there were
      pious men, beloved of the Lord, who would have cursed their sons for less
      than this: who would have sent them forth, and sent whole nations forth,
      if such had supported them, to be avoided of God and man, and perish, down
      to the baby at the breast. But I only tell you that if you ever renew that
      theme with me, I will renounce you; I will so dismiss you through that
      doorway, that you had better have been motherless from your cradle. I will
      never see or know you more. And if, after all, you were to come into this
      darkened room to look upon me lying dead, my body should bleed, if I could
      make it, when you came near me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In part relieved by the intensity of this threat, and in part (monstrous
      as the fact is) by a general impression that it was in some sort a
      religious proceeding, she handed back the book to the old man, and was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now,’ said Jeremiah; ‘premising that I’m not going to stand between you
      two, will you let me ask (as I <i>have</i> been called in, and made a
      third) what is all this about?’ 
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

      <a href="images/0066.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      ‘Take your version of it,’ returned Arthur, finding it left to him to
      speak, ‘from my mother. Let it rest there. What I have said, was said to
      my mother only.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ returned the old man. ‘From your mother? Take it from your mother?
      Well! But your mother mentioned that you had been suspecting your father.
      That’s not dutiful, Mr Arthur. Who will you be suspecting next?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Enough,’ said Mrs Clennam, turning her face so that it was addressed for
      the moment to the old man only. ‘Let no more be said about this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, but stop a bit, stop a bit,’ the old man persisted. ‘Let us see how
      we stand. Have you told Mr Arthur that he mustn’t lay offences at his
      father’s door? That he has no right to do it? That he has no ground to go
      upon?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I tell him so now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! Exactly,’ said the old man. ‘You tell him so now. You hadn’t told him
      so before, and you tell him so now. Ay, ay! That’s right! You know I stood
      between you and his father so long, that it seems as if death had made no
      difference, and I was still standing between you. So I will, and so in
      fairness I require to have that plainly put forward. Arthur, you please to
      hear that you have no right to mistrust your father, and have no ground to
      go upon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hands to the back of the wheeled chair, and muttering to
      himself, slowly wheeled his mistress back to her cabinet. ‘Now,’ he
      resumed, standing behind her: ‘in case I should go away leaving things
      half done, and so should be wanted again when you come to the other half
      and get into one of your flights, has Arthur told you what he means to do
      about the business?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He has relinquished it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In favour of nobody, I suppose?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam glanced at her son, leaning against one of the windows. He
      observed the look and said, ‘To my mother, of course. She does what she
      pleases.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if any pleasure,’ she said after a short pause, ‘could arise for me
      out of the disappointment of my expectations that my son, in the prime of
      his life, would infuse new youth and strength into it, and make it of
      great profit and power, it would be in advancing an old and faithful
      servant. Jeremiah, the captain deserts the ship, but you and I will sink
      or float with it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah, whose eyes glistened as if they saw money, darted a sudden look
      at the son, which seemed to say, ‘I owe <i>you</i> no thanks for this; <i>you</i>
      have done nothing towards it!’ and then told the mother that he thanked
      her, and that Affery thanked her, and that he would never desert her, and
      that Affery would never desert her. Finally, he hauled up his watch from
      its depths, and said, ‘Eleven. Time for your oysters!’ and with that
      change of subject, which involved no change of expression or manner, rang
      the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs Clennam, resolved to treat herself with the greater rigour for
      having been supposed to be unacquainted with reparation, refused to eat
      her oysters when they were brought. They looked tempting; eight in number,
      circularly set out on a white plate on a tray covered with a white napkin,
      flanked by a slice of buttered French roll, and a little compact glass of
      cool wine and water; but she resisted all persuasions, and sent them down
      again—placing the act to her credit, no doubt, in her Eternal
      Day-Book.
    </p>
    <p>
      This refection of oysters was not presided over by Affery, but by the girl
      who had appeared when the bell was rung; the same who had been in the
      dimly-lighted room last night. Now that he had an opportunity of observing
      her, Arthur found that her diminutive figure, small features, and slight
      spare dress, gave her the appearance of being much younger than she was. A
      woman, probably of not less than two-and-twenty, she might have been
      passed in the street for little more than half that age. Not that her face
      was very youthful, for in truth there was more consideration and care in
      it than naturally belonged to her utmost years; but she was so little and
      light, so noiseless and shy, and appeared so conscious of being out of
      place among the three hard elders, that she had all the manner and much of
      the appearance of a subdued child.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a hard way, and in an uncertain way that fluctuated between patronage
      and putting down, the sprinkling from a watering-pot and hydraulic
      pressure, Mrs Clennam showed an interest in this dependent. Even in the
      moment of her entrance, upon the violent ringing of the bell, when the
      mother shielded herself with that singular action from the son, Mrs
      Clennam’s eyes had had some individual recognition in them, which seemed
      reserved for her. As there are degrees of hardness in the hardest metal,
      and shades of colour in black itself, so, even in the asperity of Mrs
      Clennam’s demeanour towards all the rest of humanity and towards Little
      Dorrit, there was a fine gradation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit let herself out to do needlework. At so much a day—or
      at so little—from eight to eight, Little Dorrit was to be hired.
      Punctual to the moment, Little Dorrit appeared; punctual to the moment,
      Little Dorrit vanished. What became of Little Dorrit between the two
      eights was a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another of the moral phenomena of Little Dorrit. Besides her consideration
      money, her daily contract included meals. She had an extraordinary
      repugnance to dining in company; would never do so, if it were possible to
      escape. Would always plead that she had this bit of work to begin first,
      or that bit of work to finish first; and would, of a certainty, scheme and
      plan—not very cunningly, it would seem, for she deceived no one—to
      dine alone. Successful in this, happy in carrying off her plate anywhere,
      to make a table of her lap, or a box, or the ground, or even as was
      supposed, to stand on tip-toe, dining moderately at a mantel-shelf; the
      great anxiety of Little Dorrit’s day was set at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to make out Little Dorrit’s face; she was so retiring,
      plied her needle in such removed corners, and started away so scared if
      encountered on the stairs. But it seemed to be a pale transparent face,
      quick in expression, though not beautiful in feature, its soft hazel eyes
      excepted. A delicately bent head, a tiny form, a quick little pair of busy
      hands, and a shabby dress—it must needs have been very shabby to
      look at all so, being so neat—were Little Dorrit as she sat at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      For these particulars or generalities concerning Little Dorrit, Mr Arthur
      was indebted in the course of the day to his own eyes and to Mrs Affery’s
      tongue. If Mrs Affery had had any will or way of her own, it would
      probably have been unfavourable to Little Dorrit. But as ‘them two clever
      ones’—Mrs Affery’s perpetual reference, in whom her personality was
      swallowed up—were agreed to accept Little Dorrit as a matter of
      course, she had nothing for it but to follow suit. Similarly, if the two
      clever ones had agreed to murder Little Dorrit by candlelight, Mrs Affery,
      being required to hold the candle, would no doubt have done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the intervals of roasting the partridge for the invalid chamber, and
      preparing a baking-dish of beef and pudding for the dining-room, Mrs
      Affery made the communications above set forth; invariably putting her
      head in at the door again after she had taken it out, to enforce
      resistance to the two clever ones. It appeared to have become a perfect
      passion with Mrs Flintwinch, that the only son should be pitted against
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the day, too, Arthur looked through the whole house. Dull
      and dark he found it. The gaunt rooms, deserted for years upon years,
      seemed to have settled down into a gloomy lethargy from which nothing
      could rouse them again. The furniture, at once spare and lumbering, hid in
      the rooms rather than furnished them, and there was no colour in all the
      house; such colour as had ever been there, had long ago started away on
      lost sunbeams—got itself absorbed, perhaps, into flowers,
      butterflies, plumage of birds, precious stones, what not. There was not
      one straight floor from the foundation to the roof; the ceilings were so
      fantastically clouded by smoke and dust, that old women might have told
      fortunes in them better than in grouts of tea; the dead-cold hearths
      showed no traces of having ever been warmed but in heaps of soot that had
      tumbled down the chimneys, and eddied about in little dusky whirlwinds
      when the doors were opened. In what had once been a drawing-room, there
      were a pair of meagre mirrors, with dismal processions of black figures
      carrying black garlands, walking round the frames; but even these were
      short of heads and legs, and one undertaker-like Cupid had swung round on
      its own axis and got upside down, and another had fallen off altogether.
      The room Arthur Clennam’s deceased father had occupied for business
      purposes, when he first remembered him, was so unaltered that he might
      have been imagined still to keep it invisibly, as his visible relict kept
      her room up-stairs; Jeremiah Flintwinch still going between them
      negotiating.
</p>

      <a href="images/0071.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
His picture, dark and gloomy, earnestly speechless on the
      wall, with the eyes intently looking at his son as they had looked when
      life departed from them, seemed to urge him awfully to the task he had
      attempted; but as to any yielding on the part of his mother, he had now no
      hope, and as to any other means of setting his distrust at rest, he had
      abandoned hope a long time. Down in the cellars, as up in the
      bed-chambers, old objects that he well remembered were changed by age and
      decay, but were still in their old places; even to empty beer-casks hoary
      with cobwebs, and empty wine-bottles with fur and fungus choking up their
      throats. There, too, among unusual bottle-racks and pale slants of light
      from the yard above, was the strong room stored with old ledgers, which
      had as musty and corrupt a smell as if they were regularly balanced, in
      the dead small hours, by a nightly resurrection of old book-keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baking-dish was served up in a penitential manner on a shrunken cloth
      at an end of the dining-table, at two o’clock, when he dined with Mr
      Flintwinch, the new partner. Mr Flintwinch informed him that his mother
      had recovered her equanimity now, and that he need not fear her again
      alluding to what had passed in the morning. ‘And don’t you lay offences at
      your father’s door, Mr Arthur,’ added Jeremiah, ‘once for all, don’t do
      it! Now, we have done with the subject.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch had been already rearranging and dusting his own particular
      little office, as if to do honour to his accession to new dignity. He
      resumed this occupation when he was replete with beef, had sucked up all
      the gravy in the baking-dish with the flat of his knife, and had drawn
      liberally on a barrel of small beer in the scullery. Thus refreshed, he
      tucked up his shirt-sleeves and went to work again; and Mr Arthur,
      watching him as he set about it, plainly saw that his father’s picture, or
      his father’s grave, would be as communicative with him as this old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, Affery, woman,’ said Mr Flintwinch, as she crossed the hall. ‘You
      hadn’t made Mr Arthur’s bed when I was up there last. Stir yourself.
      Bustle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Arthur found the house so blank and dreary, and was so unwilling to
      assist at another implacable consignment of his mother’s enemies (perhaps
      himself among them) to mortal disfigurement and immortal ruin, that he
      announced his intention of lodging at the coffee-house where he had left
      his luggage. Mr Flintwinch taking kindly to the idea of getting rid of
      him, and his mother being indifferent, beyond considerations of saving, to
      most domestic arrangements that were not bounded by the walls of her own
      chamber, he easily carried this point without new offence. Daily business
      hours were agreed upon, which his mother, Mr Flintwinch, and he, were to
      devote together to a necessary checking of books and papers; and he left
      the home he had so lately found, with depressed heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Little Dorrit?
    </p>
    <p>
      The business hours, allowing for intervals of invalid regimen of oysters
      and partridges, during which Clennam refreshed himself with a walk, were
      from ten to six for about a fortnight. Sometimes Little Dorrit was
      employed at her needle, sometimes not, sometimes appeared as a humble
      visitor: which must have been her character on the occasion of his
      arrival. His original curiosity augmented every day, as he watched for
      her, saw or did not see her, and speculated about her. Influenced by his
      predominant idea, he even fell into a habit of discussing with himself the
      possibility of her being in some way associated with it. At last he
      resolved to watch Little Dorrit and know more of her story.

	<h3 epub:type="title">The Father of the Marshalsea</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>Thirty years ago there stood, a few doors short of the church of Saint
      George, in the borough of Southwark, on the left-hand side of the way
      going southward, the Marshalsea Prison. It had stood there many years
      before, and it remained there some years afterwards; but it is gone now,
      and the world is none the worse without it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an oblong pile of barrack building, partitioned into squalid houses
      standing back to back, so that there were no back rooms; environed by a
      narrow paved yard, hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top. Itself a
      close and confined prison for debtors, it contained within it a much
      closer and more confined jail for smugglers. Offenders against the revenue
      laws, and defaulters to excise or customs who had incurred fines which
      they were unable to pay, were supposed to be incarcerated behind an
      iron-plated door closing up a second prison, consisting of a strong cell
      or two, and a blind alley some yard and a half wide, which formed the
      mysterious termination of the very limited skittle-ground in which the
      Marshalsea debtors bowled down their troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supposed to be incarcerated there, because the time had rather outgrown
      the strong cells and the blind alley. In practice they had come to be
      considered a little too bad, though in theory they were quite as good as
      ever; which may be observed to be the case at the present day with other
      cells that are not at all strong, and with other blind alleys that are
      stone-blind. Hence the smugglers habitually consorted with the debtors
      (who received them with open arms), except at certain constitutional
      moments when somebody came from some Office, to go through some form of
      overlooking something which neither he nor anybody else knew anything
      about. On these truly British occasions, the smugglers, if any, made a
      feint of walking into the strong cells and the blind alley, while this
      somebody pretended to do his something: and made a reality of walking out
      again as soon as he hadn’t done it—neatly epitomising the
      administration of most of the public affairs in our right little, tight
      little, island.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been taken to the Marshalsea Prison, long before the day when
      the sun shone on Marseilles and on the opening of this narrative, a debtor
      with whom this narrative has some concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, at that time, a very amiable and very helpless middle-aged
      gentleman, who was going out again directly. Necessarily, he was going out
      again directly, because the Marshalsea lock never turned upon a debtor who
      was not. He brought in a portmanteau with him, which he doubted its being
      worth while to unpack; he was so perfectly clear—like all the rest
      of them, the turnkey on the lock said—that he was going out again
      directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a shy, retiring man; well-looking, though in an effeminate style;
      with a mild voice, curling hair, and irresolute hands—rings upon the
      fingers in those days—which nervously wandered to his trembling lip
      a hundred times in the first half-hour of his acquaintance with the jail.
      His principal anxiety was about his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you think, sir,’ he asked the turnkey, ‘that she will be very much
      shocked, if she should come to the gate to-morrow morning?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey gave it as the result of his experience that some of ‘em was
      and some of ‘em wasn’t. In general, more no than yes. ‘What like is she,
      you see?’ he philosophically asked: ‘that’s what it hinges on.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is very delicate and inexperienced indeed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That,’ said the turnkey, ‘is agen her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is so little used to go out alone,’ said the debtor, ‘that I am at a
      loss to think how she will ever make her way here, if she walks.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘P’raps,’ quoth the turnkey, ‘she’ll take a ackney coach.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps.’ The irresolute fingers went to the trembling lip. ‘I hope she
      will. She may not think of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Or p’raps,’ said the turnkey, offering his suggestions from the the top
      of his well-worn wooden stool, as he might have offered them to a child
      for whose weakness he felt a compassion, ‘p’raps she’ll get her brother,
      or her sister, to come along with her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She has no brother or sister.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Niece, nevy, cousin, serwant, young ‘ooman, greengrocer.—Dash it!
      One or another on ‘em,’ said the turnkey, repudiating beforehand the
      refusal of all his suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I fear—I hope it is not against the rules—that she will bring
      the children.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The children?’ said the turnkey. ‘And the rules? Why, lord set you up
      like a corner pin, we’ve a reg’lar playground o’ children here. Children!
      Why we swarm with ‘em. How many a you got?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Two,’ said the debtor, lifting his irresolute hand to his lip again, and
      turning into the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey followed him with his eyes. ‘And you another,’ he observed to
      himself, ‘which makes three on you. And your wife another, I’ll lay a
      crown. Which makes four on you. And another coming, I’ll lay half-a-crown.
      Which’ll make five on you. And I’ll go another seven and sixpence to name
      which is the helplessest, the unborn baby or you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right in all his particulars. She came next day with a little boy
      of three years old, and a little girl of two, and he stood entirely
      corroborated.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Got a room now; haven’t you?’ the turnkey asked the debtor after a week
      or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I have got a very good room.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Any little sticks a coming to furnish it?’ said the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I expect a few necessary articles of furniture to be delivered by the
      carrier, this afternoon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Missis and little ‘uns a coming to keep you company?’ asked the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, yes, we think it better that we should not be scattered, even for a
      few weeks.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Even for a few weeks, <i>of</i> course,’ replied the turnkey. And he
      followed him again with his eyes, and nodded his head seven times when he
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The affairs of this debtor were perplexed by a partnership, of which he
      knew no more than that he had invested money in it; by legal matters of
      assignment and settlement, conveyance here and conveyance there, suspicion
      of unlawful preference of creditors in this direction, and of mysterious
      spiriting away of property in that; and as nobody on the face of the earth
      could be more incapable of explaining any single item in the heap of
      confusion than the debtor himself, nothing comprehensible could be made of
      his case. To question him in detail, and endeavour to reconcile his
      answers; to closet him with accountants and sharp practitioners, learned
      in the wiles of insolvency and bankruptcy; was only to put the case out at
      compound interest and incomprehensibility. The irresolute fingers
      fluttered more and more ineffectually about the trembling lip on every
      such occasion, and the sharpest practitioners gave him up as a hopeless
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Out?’ said the turnkey, ‘<i>he</i>’ll never get out, unless his creditors
      take him by the shoulders and shove him out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been there five or six months, when he came running to this turnkey
      one forenoon to tell him, breathless and pale, that his wife was ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As anybody might a known she would be,’ said the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We intended,’ he returned, ‘that she should go to a country lodging only
      to-morrow. What am I to do! Oh, good heaven, what am I to do!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t waste your time in clasping your hands and biting your fingers,’ 
      responded the practical turnkey, taking him by the elbow, ‘but come along
      with me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey conducted him—trembling from head to foot, and
      constantly crying under his breath, What was he to do! while his
      irresolute fingers bedabbled the tears upon his face—up one of the
      common staircases in the prison to a door on the garret story. Upon which
      door the turnkey knocked with the handle of his key.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come in!’ cried a voice inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey, opening the door, disclosed in a wretched, ill-smelling
      little room, two hoarse, puffy, red-faced personages seated at a rickety
      table, playing at all-fours, smoking pipes, and drinking brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Doctor,’ said the turnkey, ‘here’s a gentleman’s wife in want of you
      without a minute’s loss of time!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor’s friend was in the positive degree of hoarseness, puffiness,
      red-facedness, all-fours, tobacco, dirt, and brandy; the doctor in the
      comparative—hoarser, puffier, more red-faced, more all-fourey,
      tobaccoer, dirtier, and brandier. The doctor was amazingly shabby, in a
      torn and darned rough-weather sea-jacket, out at elbows and eminently
      short of buttons (he had been in his time the experienced surgeon carried
      by a passenger ship), the dirtiest white trousers conceivable by mortal
      man, carpet slippers, and no visible linen. ‘Childbed?’ said the doctor.
      ‘I’m the boy!’ With that the doctor took a comb from the chimney-piece and
      stuck his hair upright—which appeared to be his way of washing
      himself—produced a professional chest or case, of most abject
      appearance, from the cupboard where his cup and saucer and coals were,
      settled his chin in the frowsy wrapper round his neck, and became a
      ghastly medical scarecrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and the debtor ran down-stairs, leaving the turnkey to return
      to the lock, and made for the debtor’s room. All the ladies in the prison
      had got hold of the news, and were in the yard. Some of them had already
      taken possession of the two children, and were hospitably carrying them
      off; others were offering loans of little comforts from their own scanty
      store; others were sympathising with the greatest volubility. The
      gentlemen prisoners, feeling themselves at a disadvantage, had for the
      most part retired, not to say sneaked, to their rooms; from the open
      windows of which some of them now complimented the doctor with whistles as
      he passed below, while others, with several stories between them,
      interchanged sarcastic references to the prevalent excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot summer day, and the prison rooms were baking between the high
      walls. In the debtor’s confined chamber, Mrs Bangham, charwoman and
      messenger, who was not a prisoner (though she had been once), but was the
      popular medium of communication with the outer world, had volunteered her
      services as fly-catcher and general attendant. The walls and ceiling were
      blackened with flies. Mrs Bangham, expert in sudden device, with one hand
      fanned the patient with a cabbage leaf, and with the other set traps of
      vinegar and sugar in gallipots; at the same time enunciating sentiments of
      an encouraging and congratulatory nature, adapted to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The flies trouble you, don’t they, my dear?’ said Mrs Bangham. ‘But
      p’raps they’ll take your mind off of it, and do you good. What between the
      buryin ground, the grocer’s, the waggon-stables, and the paunch trade, the
      Marshalsea flies gets very large. P’raps they’re sent as a consolation, if
      we only know’d it. How are you now, my dear? No better? No, my dear, it
      ain’t to be expected; you’ll be worse before you’re better, and you know
      it, don’t you? Yes. That’s right! And to think of a sweet little cherub
      being born inside the lock! Now ain’t it pretty, ain’t <i>that</i>
      something to carry you through it pleasant? Why, we ain’t had such a thing
      happen here, my dear, not for I couldn’t name the time when. And you a
      crying too?’ said Mrs Bangham, to rally the patient more and more. ‘You!
      Making yourself so famous! With the flies a falling into the gallipots by
      fifties! And everything a going on so well! And here if there ain’t,’ said
      Mrs Bangham as the door opened, ‘if there ain’t your dear gentleman along
      with Dr Haggage! And now indeed we <i>are</i> complete, I <i>think</i>!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was scarcely the kind of apparition to inspire a patient with a
      sense of absolute completeness, but as he presently delivered the opinion,
      ‘We are as right as we can be, Mrs Bangham, and we shall come out of this
      like a house afire;’ and as he and Mrs Bangham took possession of the poor
      helpless pair, as everybody else and anybody else had always done, the
      means at hand were as good on the whole as better would have been. The
      special feature in Dr Haggage’s treatment of the case, was his
      determination to keep Mrs Bangham up to the mark. As thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Bangham,’ said the doctor, before he had been there twenty minutes,
      ‘go outside and fetch a little brandy, or we shall have you giving in.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir. But none on my accounts,’ said Mrs Bangham.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Bangham,’ returned the doctor, ‘I am in professional attendance on
      this lady, and don’t choose to allow any discussion on your part. Go
      outside and fetch a little brandy, or I foresee that you’ll break down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’re to be obeyed, sir,’ said Mrs Bangham, rising. ‘If you was to put
      your own lips to it, I think you wouldn’t be the worse, for you look but
      poorly, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Bangham,’ returned the doctor, ‘I am not your business, thank you,
      but you are mine. Never you mind <i>me</i>, if you please. What you have
      got to do, is, to do as you are told, and to go and get what I bid you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Bangham submitted; and the doctor, having administered her potion,
      took his own. He repeated the treatment every hour, being very determined
      with Mrs Bangham. Three or four hours passed; the flies fell into the
      traps by hundreds; and at length one little life, hardly stronger than
      theirs, appeared among the multitude of lesser deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A very nice little girl indeed,’ said the doctor; ‘little, but
      well-formed. Halloa, Mrs Bangham! You’re looking queer! You be off, ma’am,
      this minute, and fetch a little more brandy, or we shall have you in
      hysterics.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the rings had begun to fall from the debtor’s irresolute
      hands, like leaves from a wintry tree. Not one was left upon them that
      night, when he put something that chinked into the doctor’s greasy palm.
      In the meantime Mrs Bangham had been out on an errand to a neighbouring
      establishment decorated with three golden balls, where she was very well
      known.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you,’ said the doctor, ‘thank you. Your good lady is quite
      composed. Doing charmingly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am very happy and very thankful to know it,’ said the debtor, ‘though I
      little thought once, that—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That a child would be born to you in a place like this?’ said the doctor.
      ‘Bah, bah, sir, what does it signify? A little more elbow-room is all we
      want here. We are quiet here; we don’t get badgered here; there’s no
      knocker here, sir, to be hammered at by creditors and bring a man’s heart
      into his mouth. Nobody comes here to ask if a man’s at home, and to say
      he’ll stand on the door mat till he is. Nobody writes threatening letters
      about money to this place. It’s freedom, sir, it’s freedom! I have had
      to-day’s practice at home and abroad, on a march, and aboard ship, and
      I’ll tell you this: I don’t know that I have ever pursued it under such
      quiet circumstances as here this day. Elsewhere, people are restless,
      worried, hurried about, anxious respecting one thing, anxious respecting
      another. Nothing of the kind here, sir. We have done all that—we
      know the worst of it; we have got to the bottom, we can’t fall, and what
      have we found? Peace. That’s the word for it. Peace.’ With this profession
      of faith, the doctor, who was an old jail-bird, and was more sodden than
      usual, and had the additional and unusual stimulus of money in his pocket,
      returned to his associate and chum in hoarseness, puffiness,
      red-facedness, all-fours, tobacco, dirt, and brandy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the debtor was a very different man from the doctor, but he had
      already begun to travel, by his opposite segment of the circle, to the
      same point. Crushed at first by his imprisonment, he had soon found a dull
      relief in it. He was under lock and key; but the lock and key that kept
      him in, kept numbers of his troubles out. If he had been a man with
      strength of purpose to face those troubles and fight them, he might have
      broken the net that held him, or broken his heart; but being what he was,
      he languidly slipped into this smooth descent, and never more took one
      step upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was relieved of the perplexed affairs that nothing would make
      plain, through having them returned upon his hands by a dozen agents in
      succession who could make neither beginning, middle, nor end of them or
      him, he found his miserable place of refuge a quieter refuge than it had
      been before. He had unpacked the portmanteau long ago; and his elder
      children now played regularly about the yard, and everybody knew the baby,
      and claimed a kind of proprietorship in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, I’m getting proud of you,’ said his friend the turnkey, one day.
      ‘You’ll be the oldest inhabitant soon. The Marshalsea wouldn’t be like the
      Marshalsea now, without you and your family.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey really was proud of him. He would mention him in laudatory
      terms to new-comers, when his back was turned. ‘You took notice of him,’ 
      he would say, ‘that went out of the lodge just now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      New-comer would probably answer Yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Brought up as a gentleman, he was, if ever a man was. Ed’cated at no end
      of expense. Went into the Marshal’s house once to try a new piano for him.
      Played it, I understand, like one o’clock—beautiful! As to languages—speaks
      anything. We’ve had a Frenchman here in his time, and it’s my opinion he
      knowed more French than the Frenchman did. We’ve had an Italian here in
      his time, and he shut <i>him</i> up in about half a minute. You’ll find
      some characters behind other locks, I don’t say you won’t; but if you want
      the top sawyer in such respects as I’ve mentioned, you must come to the
      Marshalsea.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When his youngest child was eight years old, his wife, who had long been
      languishing away—of her own inherent weakness, not that she retained
      any greater sensitiveness as to her place of abode than he did—went
      upon a visit to a poor friend and old nurse in the country, and died
      there. He remained shut up in his room for a fortnight afterwards; and an
      attorney’s clerk, who was going through the Insolvent Court, engrossed an
      address of condolence to him, which looked like a Lease, and which all the
      prisoners signed. When he appeared again he was greyer (he had soon begun
      to turn grey); and the turnkey noticed that his hands went often to his
      trembling lips again, as they had used to do when he first came in. But he
      got pretty well over it in a month or two; and in the meantime the
      children played about the yard as regularly as ever, but in black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs Bangham, long popular medium of communication with the outer
      world, began to be infirm, and to be found oftener than usual comatose on
      pavements, with her basket of purchases spilt, and the change of her
      clients ninepence short. His son began to supersede Mrs Bangham, and to
      execute commissions in a knowing manner, and to be of the prison
      prisonous, of the streets streety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time went on, and the turnkey began to fail. His chest swelled, and his
      legs got weak, and he was short of breath. The well-worn wooden stool was
      ‘beyond him,’ he complained. He sat in an arm-chair with a cushion, and
      sometimes wheezed so, for minutes together, that he couldn’t turn the key.
      When he was overpowered by these fits, the debtor often turned it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You and me,’ said the turnkey, one snowy winter’s night when the lodge,
      with a bright fire in it, was pretty full of company, ‘is the oldest
      inhabitants. I wasn’t here myself above seven year before you. I shan’t
      last long. When I’m off the lock for good and all, you’ll be the Father of
      the Marshalsea.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey went off the lock of this world next day. His words were
      remembered and repeated; and tradition afterwards handed down from
      generation to generation—a Marshalsea generation might be calculated
      as about three months—that the shabby old debtor with the soft
      manner and the white hair, was the Father of the Marshalsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he grew to be proud of the title. If any impostor had arisen to claim
      it, he would have shed tears in resentment of the attempt to deprive him
      of his rights. A disposition began to be perceived in him to exaggerate
      the number of years he had been there; it was generally understood that
      you must deduct a few from his account; he was vain, the fleeting
      generations of debtors said.
    </p>
    <p>
      All new-comers were presented to him. He was punctilious in the exaction
      of this ceremony. The wits would perform the office of introduction with
      overcharged pomp and politeness, but they could not easily overstep his
      sense of its gravity. He received them in his poor room (he disliked an
      introduction in the mere yard, as informal—a thing that might happen
      to anybody), with a kind of bowed-down beneficence. They were welcome to
      the Marshalsea, he would tell them. Yes, he was the Father of the place.
      So the world was kind enough to call him; and so he was, if more than
      twenty years of residence gave him a claim to the title. It looked small
      at first, but there was very good company there—among a mixture—necessarily
      a mixture—and very good air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became a not unusual circumstance for letters to be put under his door
      at night, enclosing half-a-crown, two half-crowns, now and then at long
      intervals even half-a-sovereign, for the Father of the Marshalsea. ‘With
      the compliments of a collegian taking leave.’ He received the gifts as
      tributes, from admirers, to a public character. Sometimes these
      correspondents assumed facetious names, as the Brick, Bellows, Old
      Gooseberry, Wideawake, Snooks, Mops, Cutaway, the Dogs-meat Man; but he
      considered this in bad taste, and was always a little hurt by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fulness of time, this correspondence showing signs of wearing out,
      and seeming to require an effort on the part of the correspondents to
      which in the hurried circumstances of departure many of them might not be
      equal, he established the custom of attending collegians of a certain
      standing, to the gate, and taking leave of them there. The collegian under
      treatment, after shaking hands, would occasionally stop to wrap up
      something in a bit of paper, and would come back again calling ‘Hi!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would look round surprised.‘Me?’ he would say, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the collegian would be up with him, and he would paternally
      add, ‘What have you forgotten? What can I do for you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I forgot to leave this,’ the collegian would usually return, ‘for the
      Father of the Marshalsea.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My good sir,’ he would rejoin, ‘he is infinitely obliged to you.’ But, to
      the last, the irresolute hand of old would remain in the pocket into which
      he had slipped the money during two or three turns about the yard, lest
      the transaction should be too conspicuous to the general body of
      collegians.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he had been doing the honours of the place to a rather large
      party of collegians, who happened to be going out, when, as he was coming
      back, he encountered one from the poor side who had been taken in
      execution for a small sum a week before, had ‘settled’ in the course of
      that afternoon, and was going out too. The man was a mere Plasterer in his
      working dress; had his wife with him, and a bundle; and was in high
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘God bless you, sir,’ he said in passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you,’ benignantly returned the Father of the Marshalsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were pretty far divided, going their several ways, when the Plasterer
      called out, ‘I say!—sir!’ and came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It ain’t much,’ said the Plasterer, putting a little pile of halfpence in
      his hand, ‘but it’s well meant.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea had never been offered tribute in copper yet.
      His children often had, and with his perfect acquiescence it had gone into
      the common purse to buy meat that he had eaten, and drink that he had
      drunk; but fustian splashed with white lime, bestowing halfpence on him,
      front to front, was new.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How dare you!’ he said to the man, and feebly burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Plasterer turned him towards the wall, that his face might not be
      seen; and the action was so delicate, and the man was so penetrated with
      repentance, and asked pardon so honestly, that he could make him no less
      acknowledgment than, ‘I know you meant it kindly. Say no more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bless your soul, sir,’ urged the Plasterer, ‘I did indeed. I’d do more by
      you than the rest of ‘em do, I fancy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What would you do?’ he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I’d come back to see you, after I was let out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Give me the money again,’ said the other, eagerly, ‘and I’ll keep it, and
      never spend it. Thank you for it, thank you! I shall see you again?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I live a week you shall.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands and parted. The collegians, assembled in Symposium in the
      Snuggery that night, marvelled what had happened to their Father; he
      walked so late in the shadows of the yard, and seemed so downcast.

	<h3 epub:type="title">The Child of the Marshalsea</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>The baby whose first draught of air had been tinctured with Doctor
      Haggage’s brandy, was handed down among the generations of collegians,
      like the tradition of their common parent. In the earlier stages of her
      existence, she was handed down in a literal and prosaic sense; it being
      almost a part of the entrance footing of every new collegian to nurse the
      child who had been born in the college.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By rights,’ remarked the turnkey when she was first shown to him, ‘I
      ought to be her godfather.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The debtor irresolutely thought of it for a minute, and said, ‘Perhaps you
      wouldn’t object to really being her godfather?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! <i>I</i> don’t object,’ replied the turnkey, ‘if you don’t.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it came to pass that she was christened one Sunday afternoon, when
      the turnkey, being relieved, was off the lock; and that the turnkey went
      up to the font of Saint George’s Church, and promised and vowed and
      renounced on her behalf, as he himself related when he came back, ‘like a
      good ‘un.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This invested the turnkey with a new proprietary share in the child, over
      and above his former official one. When she began to walk and talk, he
      became fond of her; bought a little arm-chair and stood it by the high
      fender of the lodge fire-place; liked to have her company when he was on
      the lock; and used to bribe her with cheap toys to come and talk to him.
      The child, for her part, soon grew so fond of the turnkey that she would
      come climbing up the lodge-steps of her own accord at all hours of the
      day. When she fell asleep in the little armchair by the high fender, the
      turnkey would cover her with his pocket-handkerchief; and when she sat in
      it dressing and undressing a doll which soon came to be unlike dolls on
      the other side of the lock, and to bear a horrible family resemblance to
      Mrs Bangham—he would contemplate her from the top of his stool with
      exceeding gentleness. Witnessing these things, the collegians would
      express an opinion that the turnkey, who was a bachelor, had been cut out
      by nature for a family man. But the turnkey thanked them, and said, ‘No,
      on the whole it was enough to see other people’s children there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At what period of her early life the little creature began to perceive
      that it was not the habit of all the world to live locked up in narrow
      yards surrounded by high walls with spikes at the top, would be a
      difficult question to settle. But she was a very, very little creature
      indeed, when she had somehow gained the knowledge that her clasp of her
      father’s hand was to be always loosened at the door which the great key
      opened; and that while her own light steps were free to pass beyond it,
      his feet must never cross that line. A pitiful and plaintive look, with
      which she had begun to regard him when she was still extremely young, was
      perhaps a part of this discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a pitiful and plaintive look for everything, indeed, but with
      something in it for only him that was like protection, this Child of the
      Marshalsea and the child of the Father of the Marshalsea, sat by her
      friend the turnkey in the lodge, kept the family room, or wandered about
      the prison-yard, for the first eight years of her life. With a pitiful and
      plaintive look for her wayward sister; for her idle brother; for the high
      blank walls; for the faded crowd they shut in; for the games of the prison
      children as they whooped and ran, and played at hide-and-seek, and made
      the iron bars of the inner gateway ‘Home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Wistful and wondering, she would sit in summer weather by the high fender
      in the lodge, looking up at the sky through the barred window, until, when
      she turned her eyes away, bars of light would arise between her and her
      friend, and she would see him through a grating, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thinking of the fields,’ the turnkey said once, after watching her,
      ‘ain’t you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where are they?’ she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, they’re—over there, my dear,’ said the turnkey, with a vague
      flourish of his key. ‘Just about there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does anybody open them, and shut them? Are they locked?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey was discomfited. ‘Well,’ he said. ‘Not in general.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are they very pretty, Bob?’ She called him Bob, by his own particular
      request and instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lovely. Full of flowers. There’s buttercups, and there’s daisies, and
      there’s’—the turnkey hesitated, being short of floral nomenclature—‘there’s
      dandelions, and all manner of games.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it very pleasant to be there, Bob?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Prime,’ said the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Was father ever there?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hem!’ coughed the turnkey. ‘O yes, he was there, sometimes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is he sorry not to be there now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘N-not particular,’ said the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nor any of the people?’ she asked, glancing at the listless crowd within.
      ‘O are you quite sure and certain, Bob?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this difficult point of the conversation Bob gave in, and changed the
      subject to hard-bake: always his last resource when he found his little
      friend getting him into a political, social, or theological corner. But
      this was the origin of a series of Sunday excursions that these two
      curious companions made together. They used to issue from the lodge on
      alternate Sunday afternoons with great gravity, bound for some meadows or
      green lanes that had been elaborately appointed by the turnkey in the
      course of the week; and there she picked grass and flowers to bring home,
      while he smoked his pipe. Afterwards, there were tea-gardens, shrimps,
      ale, and other delicacies; and then they would come back hand in hand,
      unless she was more than usually tired, and had fallen asleep on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those early days, the turnkey first began profoundly to consider a
      question which cost him so much mental labour, that it remained
      undetermined on the day of his death. He decided to will and bequeath his
      little property of savings to his godchild, and the point arose how could
      it be so ‘tied up’ as that only she should have the benefit of it? His
      experience on the lock gave him such an acute perception of the enormous
      difficulty of ‘tying up’ money with any approach to tightness, and
      contrariwise of the remarkable ease with which it got loose, that through
      a series of years he regularly propounded this knotty point to every new
      insolvent agent and other professional gentleman who passed in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Supposing,’ he would say, stating the case with his key on the
      professional gentleman’s waistcoat; ‘supposing a man wanted to leave his
      property to a young female, and wanted to tie it up so that nobody else
      should ever be able to make a grab at it; how would you tie up that
      property?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Settle it strictly on herself,’ the professional gentleman would
      complacently answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But look here,’ quoth the turnkey. ‘Supposing she had, say a brother, say
      a father, say a husband, who would be likely to make a grab at that
      property when she came into it—how about that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It would be settled on herself, and they would have no more legal claim
      on it than you,’ would be the professional answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stop a bit,’ said the turnkey. ‘Supposing she was tender-hearted, and
      they came over her. Where’s your law for tying it up then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The deepest character whom the turnkey sounded, was unable to produce his
      law for tying such a knot as that. So, the turnkey thought about it all
      his life, and died intestate after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was long afterwards, when his god-daughter was past sixteen. The
      first half of that space of her life was only just accomplished, when her
      pitiful and plaintive look saw her father a widower. From that time the
      protection that her wondering eyes had expressed towards him, became
      embodied in action, and the Child of the Marshalsea took upon herself a
      new relation towards the Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, such a baby could do little more than sit with him, deserting
      her livelier place by the high fender, and quietly watching him. But this
      made her so far necessary to him that he became accustomed to her, and
      began to be sensible of missing her when she was not there. Through this
      little gate, she passed out of childhood into the care-laden world.
    </p>
    <p>
      What her pitiful look saw, at that early time, in her father, in her
      sister, in her brother, in the jail; how much, or how little of the
      wretched truth it pleased God to make visible to her; lies hidden with
      many mysteries. It is enough that she was inspired to be something which
      was not what the rest were, and to be that something, different and
      laborious, for the sake of the rest. Inspired? Yes. Shall we speak of the
      inspiration of a poet or a priest, and not of the heart impelled by love
      and self-devotion to the lowliest work in the lowliest way of life!
    </p>
    <p>
      With no earthly friend to help her, or so much as to see her, but the one
      so strangely assorted; with no knowledge even of the common daily tone and
      habits of the common members of the free community who are not shut up in
      prisons; born and bred in a social condition, false even with a reference
      to the falsest condition outside the walls; drinking from infancy of a
      well whose waters had their own peculiar stain, their own unwholesome and
      unnatural taste; the Child of the Marshalsea began her womanly life.
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter through what mistakes and discouragements, what ridicule (not
      unkindly meant, but deeply felt) of her youth and little figure, what
      humble consciousness of her own babyhood and want of strength, even in the
      matter of lifting and carrying; through how much weariness and
      hopelessness, and how many secret tears; she drudged on, until recognised
      as useful, even indispensable. That time came. She took the place of
      eldest of the three, in all things but precedence; was the head of the
      fallen family; and bore, in her own heart, its anxieties and shames.
    </p>
    <p>
      At thirteen, she could read and keep accounts, that is, could put down in
      words and figures how much the bare necessaries that they wanted would
      cost, and how much less they had to buy them with. She had been, by
      snatches of a few weeks at a time, to an evening school outside, and got
      her sister and brother sent to day-schools by desultory starts, during
      three or four years. There was no instruction for any of them at home; but
      she knew well—no one better—that a man so broken as to be the
      Father of the Marshalsea, could be no father to his own children.
    </p>
    <p>
      To these scanty means of improvement, she added another of her own
      contriving. Once, among the heterogeneous crowd of inmates there appeared
      a dancing-master. Her sister had a great desire to learn the
      dancing-master’s art, and seemed to have a taste that way. At thirteen
      years old, the Child of the Marshalsea presented herself to the
      dancing-master, with a little bag in her hand, and preferred her humble
      petition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you please, I was born here, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! You are the young lady, are you?’ said the dancing-master, surveying
      the small figure and uplifted face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what can I do for you?’ said the dancing-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing for me, sir, thank you,’ anxiously undrawing the strings of the
      little bag; ‘but if, while you stay here, you could be so kind as to teach
      my sister cheap—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My child, I’ll teach her for nothing,’ said the dancing-master, shutting
      up the bag. He was as good-natured a dancing-master as ever danced to the
      Insolvent Court, and he kept his word. The sister was so apt a pupil, and
      the dancing-master had such abundant leisure to bestow upon her (for it
      took him a matter of ten weeks to set to his creditors, lead off, turn the
      Commissioners, and right and left back to his professional pursuits), that
      wonderful progress was made. Indeed the dancing-master was so proud of it,
      and so wishful to display it before he left to a few select friends among
      the collegians, that at six o’clock on a certain fine morning, a minuet de
      la cour came off in the yard—the college-rooms being of too confined
      proportions for the purpose—in which so much ground was covered, and
      the steps were so conscientiously executed, that the dancing-master,
      having to play the kit besides, was thoroughly blown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of this beginning, which led to the dancing-master’s
      continuing his instruction after his release, emboldened the poor child to
      try again. She watched and waited months for a seamstress. In the fulness
      of time a milliner came in, and to her she repaired on her own behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon, ma’am,’ she said, looking timidly round the door of
      the milliner, whom she found in tears and in bed: ‘but I was born here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody seemed to hear of her as soon as they arrived; for the milliner
      sat up in bed, drying her eyes, and said, just as the dancing-master had
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! <i>You</i> are the child, are you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sorry I haven’t got anything for you,’ said the milliner, shaking
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s not that, ma’am. If you please I want to learn needle-work.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why should you do that,’ returned the milliner, ‘with me before you? It
      has not done me much good.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing—whatever it is—seems to have done anybody much good
      who comes here,’ she returned in all simplicity; ‘but I want to learn just
      the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am afraid you are so weak, you see,’ the milliner objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t think I am weak, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you are so very, very little, you see,’ the milliner objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I am afraid I am very little indeed,’ returned the Child of the
      Marshalsea; and so began to sob over that unfortunate defect of hers,
      which came so often in her way. The milliner—who was not morose or
      hard-hearted, only newly insolvent—was touched, took her in hand
      with goodwill, found her the most patient and earnest of pupils, and made
      her a cunning work-woman in course of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time, and in the very self-same course of time, the Father of
      the Marshalsea gradually developed a new flower of character. The more
      Fatherly he grew as to the Marshalsea, and the more dependent he became on
      the contributions of his changing family, the greater stand he made by his
      forlorn gentility. With the same hand that he pocketed a collegian’s
      half-crown half an hour ago, he would wipe away the tears that streamed
      over his cheeks if any reference were made to his daughters’ earning their
      bread. So, over and above other daily cares, the Child of the Marshalsea
      had always upon her the care of preserving the genteel fiction that they
      were all idle beggars together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sister became a dancer. There was a ruined uncle in the family group—ruined
      by his brother, the Father of the Marshalsea, and knowing no more how than
      his ruiner did, but accepting the fact as an inevitable certainty—on
      whom her protection devolved. Naturally a retired and simple man, he had
      shown no particular sense of being ruined at the time when that calamity
      fell upon him, further than that he left off washing himself when the
      shock was announced, and never took to that luxury any more. He had been a
      very indifferent musical amateur in his better days; and when he fell with
      his brother, resorted for support to playing a clarionet as dirty as
      himself in a small Theatre Orchestra. It was the theatre in which his
      niece became a dancer; he had been a fixture there a long time when she
      took her poor station in it; and he accepted the task of serving as her
      escort and guardian, just as he would have accepted an illness, a legacy,
      a feast, starvation—anything but soap.
    </p>
    <p>
      To enable this girl to earn her few weekly shillings, it was necessary for
      the Child of the Marshalsea to go through an elaborate form with the
      Father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fanny is not going to live with us just now, father. She will be here a
      good deal in the day, but she is going to live outside with uncle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You surprise me. Why?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think uncle wants a companion, father. He should be attended to, and
      looked after.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A companion? He passes much of his time here. And you attend to him and
      look after him, Amy, a great deal more than ever your sister will. You all
      go out so much; you all go out so much.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was to keep up the ceremony and pretence of his having no idea that
      Amy herself went out by the day to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But we are always glad to come home, father; now, are we not? And as to
      Fanny, perhaps besides keeping uncle company and taking care of him, it
      may be as well for her not quite to live here, always. She was not born
      here as I was, you know, father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Amy, well. I don’t quite follow you, but it’s natural I suppose
      that Fanny should prefer to be outside, and even that you often should,
      too. So, you and Fanny and your uncle, my dear, shall have your own way.
      Good, good. I’ll not meddle; don’t mind me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To get her brother out of the prison; out of the succession to Mrs Bangham
      in executing commissions, and out of the slang interchange with very
      doubtful companions consequent upon both; was her hardest task. At
      eighteen he would have dragged on from hand to mouth, from hour to hour,
      from penny to penny, until eighty. Nobody got into the prison from whom he
      derived anything useful or good, and she could find no patron for him but
      her old friend and godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear Bob,’ said she, ‘what is to become of poor Tip?’ His name was
      Edward, and Ted had been transformed into Tip, within the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey had strong private opinions as to what would become of poor
      Tip, and had even gone so far with the view of averting their fulfilment,
      as to sound Tip in reference to the expediency of running away and going
      to serve his country. But Tip had thanked him, and said he didn’t seem to
      care for his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, my dear,’ said the turnkey, ‘something ought to be done with him.
      Suppose I try and get him into the law?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That would be so good of you, Bob!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The turnkey had now two points to put to the professional gentlemen as
      they passed in and out. He put this second one so perseveringly that a
      stool and twelve shillings a week were at last found for Tip in the office
      of an attorney in a great National Palladium called the Palace Court; at
      that time one of a considerable list of everlasting bulwarks to the
      dignity and safety of Albion, whose places know them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip languished in Clifford’s Inns for six months, and at the expiration of
      that term sauntered back one evening with his hands in his pockets, and
      incidentally observed to his sister that he was not going back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not going back again?’ said the poor little anxious Child of the
      Marshalsea, always calculating and planning for Tip, in the front rank of
      her charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am so tired of it,’ said Tip, ‘that I have cut it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip tired of everything. With intervals of Marshalsea lounging, and Mrs
      Bangham succession, his small second mother, aided by her trusty friend,
      got him into a warehouse, into a market garden, into the hop trade, into
      the law again, into an auctioneers, into a brewery, into a stockbroker’s,
      into the law again, into a coach office, into a waggon office, into the
      law again, into a general dealer’s, into a distillery, into the law again,
      into a wool house, into a dry goods house, into the Billingsgate trade,
      into the foreign fruit trade, and into the docks. But whatever Tip went
      into, he came out of tired, announcing that he had cut it. Wherever he
      went, this foredoomed Tip appeared to take the prison walls with him, and
      to set them up in such trade or calling; and to prowl about within their
      narrow limits in the old slip-shod, purposeless, down-at-heel way; until
      the real immovable Marshalsea walls asserted their fascination over him,
      and brought him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the brave little creature did so fix her heart on her
      brother’s rescue, that while he was ringing out these doleful changes, she
      pinched and scraped enough together to ship him for Canada. When he was
      tired of nothing to do, and disposed in its turn to cut even that, he
      graciously consented to go to Canada. And there was grief in her bosom
      over parting with him, and joy in the hope of his being put in a straight
      course at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘God bless you, dear Tip. Don’t be too proud to come and see us, when you
      have made your fortune.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All right!’ said Tip, and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not all the way to Canada; in fact, not further than Liverpool. After
      making the voyage to that port from London, he found himself so strongly
      impelled to cut the vessel, that he resolved to walk back again. Carrying
      out which intention, he presented himself before her at the expiration of
      a month, in rags, without shoes, and much more tired than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after another interval of successorship to Mrs Bangham, he
      found a pursuit for himself, and announced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy, I have got a situation.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you really and truly, Tip?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All right. I shall do now. You needn’t look anxious about me any more,
      old girl.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it, Tip?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, you know Slingo by sight?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not the man they call the dealer?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s the chap. He’ll be out on Monday, and he’s going to give me a
      berth.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is he a dealer in, Tip?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Horses. All right! I shall do now, Amy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She lost sight of him for months afterwards, and only heard from him once.
      A whisper passed among the elder collegians that he had been seen at a
      mock auction in Moorfields, pretending to buy plated articles for massive
      silver, and paying for them with the greatest liberality in bank notes;
      but it never reached her ears. One evening she was alone at work—standing
      up at the window, to save the twilight lingering above the wall—when
      he opened the door and walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She kissed and welcomed him; but was afraid to ask him any questions. He
      saw how anxious and timid she was, and appeared sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am afraid, Amy, you’ll be vexed this time. Upon my life I am!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am very sorry to hear you say so, Tip. Have you come back?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why—yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not expecting this time that what you had found would answer very well, I
      am less surprised and sorry than I might have been, Tip.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! But that’s not the worst of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not the worst of it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t look so startled. No, Amy, not the worst of it. I have come back,
      you see; but—<i>don’t</i> look so startled—I have come back in
      what I may call a new way. I am off the volunteer list altogether. I am in
      now, as one of the regulars.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! Don’t say you are a prisoner, Tip! Don’t, don’t!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I don’t want to say it,’ he returned in a reluctant tone; ‘but if
      you can’t understand me without my saying it, what am I to do? I am in for
      forty pound odd.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in all those years, she sunk under her cares. She
      cried, with her clasped hands lifted above her head, that it would kill
      their father if he ever knew it; and fell down at Tip’s graceless feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easier for Tip to bring her to her senses than for her to bring <i>him</i>
      to understand that the Father of the Marshalsea would be beside himself if
      he knew the truth. The thing was incomprehensible to Tip, and altogether a
      fanciful notion. He yielded to it in that light only, when he submitted to
      her entreaties, backed by those of his uncle and sister. There was no want
      of precedent for his return; it was accounted for to the father in the
      usual way; and the collegians, with a better comprehension of the pious
      fraud than Tip, supported it loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the life, and this the history, of the child of the Marshalsea at
      twenty-two. With a still surviving attachment to the one miserable yard
      and block of houses as her birthplace and home, she passed to and fro in
      it shrinkingly now, with a womanly consciousness that she was pointed out
      to every one. Since she had begun to work beyond the walls, she had found
      it necessary to conceal where she lived, and to come and go as secretly as
      she could, between the free city and the iron gates, outside of which she
      had never slept in her life. Her original timidity had grown with this
      concealment, and her light step and her little figure shunned the thronged
      streets while they passed along them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worldly wise in hard and poor necessities, she was innocent in all things
      else. Innocent, in the mist through which she saw her father, and the
      prison, and the turbid living river that flowed through it and flowed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the life, and this the history, of Little Dorrit; now going home
      upon a dull September evening, observed at a distance by Arthur Clennam.
      This was the life, and this the history, of Little Dorrit; turning at the
      end of London Bridge, recrossing it, going back again, passing on to Saint
      George’s Church, turning back suddenly once more, and flitting in at the
      open outer gate and little court-yard of the Marshalsea.

<p>Arthur Clennam stood in the street, waiting to ask some passer-by what
      place that was. He suffered a few people to pass him in whose face there
      was no encouragement to make the inquiry, and still stood pausing in the
      street, when an old man came up and turned into the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped a good deal, and plodded along in a slow pre-occupied manner,
      which made the bustling London thoroughfares no very safe resort for him.
      He was dirtily and meanly dressed, in a threadbare coat, once blue,
      reaching to his ankles and buttoned to his chin, where it vanished in the
      pale ghost of a velvet collar. A piece of red cloth with which that
      phantom had been stiffened in its lifetime was now laid bare, and poked
      itself up, at the back of the old man’s neck, into a confusion of grey
      hair and rusty stock and buckle which altogether nearly poked his hat off.
      A greasy hat it was, and a napless; impending over his eyes, cracked and
      crumpled at the brim, and with a wisp of pocket-handkerchief dangling out
      below it. His trousers were so long and loose, and his shoes so clumsy and
      large, that he shuffled like an elephant; though how much of this was
      gait, and how much trailing cloth and leather, no one could have told.
      Under one arm he carried a limp and worn-out case, containing some wind
      instrument; in the same hand he had a pennyworth of snuff in a little
      packet of whitey-brown paper, from which he slowly comforted his poor blue
      old nose with a lengthened-out pinch, as Arthur Clennam looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this old man crossing the court-yard, he preferred his inquiry,
      touching him on the shoulder. The old man stopped and looked round, with
      the expression in his weak grey eyes of one whose thoughts had been far
      off, and who was a little dull of hearing also.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray, sir,’ said Arthur, repeating his question, ‘what is this place?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay! This place?’ returned the old man, staying his pinch of snuff on its
      road, and pointing at the place without looking at it. ‘This is the
      Marshalsea, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The debtors’ prison?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir,’ said the old man, with the air of deeming it not quite necessary to
      insist upon that designation, ‘the debtors’ prison.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned himself about, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Arthur, stopping him once more, ‘but will you
      allow me to ask you another question? Can any one go in here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Any one can <i>go in</i>,’ replied the old man; plainly adding by the
      significance of his emphasis, ‘but it is not every one who can go out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pardon me once more. Are you familiar with the place?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir,’ returned the old man, squeezing his little packet of snuff in his
      hand, and turning upon his interrogator as if such questions hurt him. ‘I
      am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg you to excuse me. I am not impertinently curious, but have a good
      object. Do you know the name of Dorrit here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My name, sir,’ replied the old man most unexpectedly, ‘is Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur pulled off his hat to him. ‘Grant me the favour of half-a-dozen
      words. I was wholly unprepared for your announcement, and hope that
      assurance is my sufficient apology for having taken the liberty of
      addressing you. I have recently come home to England after a long absence.
      I have seen at my mother’s—Mrs Clennam in the city—a young
      woman working at her needle, whom I have only heard addressed or spoken of
      as Little Dorrit. I have felt sincerely interested in her, and have had a
      great desire to know something more about her. I saw her, not a minute
      before you came up, pass in at that door.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked at him attentively. ‘Are you a sailor, sir?’ he asked.
      He seemed a little disappointed by the shake of the head that replied to
      him. ‘Not a sailor? I judged from your sunburnt face that you might be.
      Are you in earnest, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do assure you that I am, and do entreat you to believe that I am, in
      plain earnest.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know very little of the world, sir,’ returned the other, who had a weak
      and quavering voice. ‘I am merely passing on, like the shadow over the
      sun-dial. It would be worth no man’s while to mislead me; it would really
      be too easy—too poor a success, to yield any satisfaction. The young
      woman whom you saw go in here is my brother’s child. My brother is William
      Dorrit; I am Frederick. You say you have seen her at your mother’s (I know
      your mother befriends her), you have felt an interest in her, and you wish
      to know what she does here. Come and see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on again, and Arthur accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My brother,’ said the old man, pausing on the step and slowly facing
      round again, ‘has been here many years; and much that happens even among
      ourselves, out of doors, is kept from him for reasons that I needn’t enter
      upon now. Be so good as to say nothing of my niece’s working at her
      needle. Be so good as to say nothing that goes beyond what is said among
      us. If you keep within our bounds, you cannot well be wrong. Now! Come and
      see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur followed him down a narrow entry, at the end of which a key was
      turned, and a strong door was opened from within. It admitted them into a
      lodge or lobby, across which they passed, and so through another door and
      a grating into the prison. The old man always plodding on before, turned
      round, in his slow, stiff, stooping manner, when they came to the turnkey
      on duty, as if to present his companion. The turnkey nodded; and the
      companion passed in without being asked whom he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark; and the prison lamps in the yard, and the candles in
      the prison windows faintly shining behind many sorts of wry old curtain
      and blind, had not the air of making it lighter. A few people loitered
      about, but the greater part of the population was within doors. The old
      man, taking the right-hand side of the yard, turned in at the third or
      fourth doorway, and began to ascend the stairs. ‘They are rather dark,
      sir, but you will not find anything in the way.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused for a moment before opening a door on the second story. He had
      no sooner turned the handle than the visitor saw Little Dorrit, and saw
      the reason of her setting so much store by dining alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought the meat home that she should have eaten herself, and was
      already warming it on a gridiron over the fire for her father, clad in an
      old grey gown and a black cap, awaiting his supper at the table. A clean
      cloth was spread before him, with knife, fork, and spoon, salt-cellar,
      pepper-box, glass, and pewter ale-pot. Such zests as his particular little
      phial of cayenne pepper and his pennyworth of pickles in a saucer, were
      not wanting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started, coloured deeply, and turned white. The visitor, more with his
      eyes than by the slight impulsive motion of his hand, entreated her to be
      reassured and to trust him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I found this gentleman,’ said the uncle—‘Mr Clennam, William, son
      of Amy’s friend—at the outer gate, wishful, as he was going by, of
      paying his respects, but hesitating whether to come in or not. This is my
      brother William, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope,’ said Arthur, very doubtful what to say, ‘that my respect for
      your daughter may explain and justify my desire to be presented to you,
      sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam,’ returned the other, rising, taking his cap off in the flat
      of his hand, and so holding it, ready to put on again, ‘you do me honour.
      You are welcome, sir;’ with a low bow. ‘Frederick, a chair. Pray sit down,
      Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his black cap on again as he had taken it off, and resumed his own
      seat. There was a wonderful air of benignity and patronage in his manner.
      These were the ceremonies with which he received the collegians.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are welcome to the Marshalsea, sir. I have welcomed many gentlemen to
      these walls. Perhaps you are aware—my daughter Amy may have
      mentioned that I am the Father of this place.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I—so I have understood,’ said Arthur, dashing at the assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You know, I dare say, that my daughter Amy was born here. A good girl,
      sir, a dear girl, and long a comfort and support to me. Amy, my dear, put
      this dish on; Mr Clennam will excuse the primitive customs to which we are
      reduced here. Is it a compliment to ask you if you would do me the honour,
      sir, to—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you,’ returned Arthur. ‘Not a morsel.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself quite lost in wonder at the manner of the man, and that
      the probability of his daughter’s having had a reserve as to her family
      history, should be so far out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She filled his glass, put all the little matters on the table ready to his
      hand, and then sat beside him while he ate his supper. Evidently in
      observance of their nightly custom, she put some bread before herself, and
      touched his glass with her lips; but Arthur saw she was troubled and took
      nothing. Her look at her father, half admiring him and proud of him, half
      ashamed for him, all devoted and loving, went to his inmost heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea condescended towards his brother as an
      amiable, well-meaning man; a private character, who had not arrived at
      distinction. ‘Frederick,’ said he, ‘you and Fanny sup at your lodgings
      to-night, I know. What have you done with Fanny, Frederick?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is walking with Tip.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tip—as you may know—is my son, Mr Clennam. He has been a
      little wild, and difficult to settle, but his introduction to the world
      was rather’—he shrugged his shoulders with a faint sigh, and looked
      round the room—‘a little adverse. Your first visit here, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My first.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You could hardly have been here since your boyhood without my knowledge.
      It very seldom happens that anybody—of any pretensions—any
      pretensions—comes here without being presented to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As many as forty or fifty in a day have been introduced to my brother,’ 
      said Frederick, faintly lighting up with a ray of pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes!’ the Father of the Marshalsea assented. ‘We have even exceeded that
      number. On a fine Sunday in term time, it is quite a Levee—quite a
      Levee. Amy, my dear, I have been trying half the day to remember the name
      of the gentleman from Camberwell who was introduced to me last Christmas
      week by that agreeable coal-merchant who was remanded for six months.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t remember his name, father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Frederick, do <i>you</i> remember his name?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick doubted if he had ever heard it. No one could doubt that
      Frederick was the last person upon earth to put such a question to, with
      any hope of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I mean,’ said his brother, ‘the gentleman who did that handsome action
      with so much delicacy. Ha! Tush! The name has quite escaped me. Mr
      Clennam, as I have happened to mention handsome and delicate action, you
      may like, perhaps, to know what it was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very much,’ said Arthur, withdrawing his eyes from the delicate head
      beginning to droop and the pale face with a new solicitude stealing over
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is so generous, and shows so much fine feeling, that it is almost a
      duty to mention it. I said at the time that I always would mention it on
      every suitable occasion, without regard to personal sensitiveness. A—well—a—it’s
      of no use to disguise the fact—you must know, Mr Clennam, that it
      does sometimes occur that people who come here desire to offer some little—Testimonial—to
      the Father of the place.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To see her hand upon his arm in mute entreaty half-repressed, and her
      timid little shrinking figure turning away, was to see a sad, sad sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sometimes,’ he went on in a low, soft voice, agitated, and clearing his
      throat every now and then; ‘sometimes—hem—it takes one shape
      and sometimes another; but it is generally—ha—Money. And it
      is, I cannot but confess it, it is too often—hem—acceptable.
      This gentleman that I refer to, was presented to me, Mr Clennam, in a
      manner highly gratifying to my feelings, and conversed not only with great
      politeness, but with great—ahem—information.’ All this time,
      though he had finished his supper, he was nervously going about his plate
      with his knife and fork, as if some of it were still before him. ‘It
      appeared from his conversation that he had a garden, though he was
      delicate of mentioning it at first, as gardens are—hem—are not
      accessible to me. But it came out, through my admiring a very fine cluster
      of geranium—beautiful cluster of geranium to be sure—which he
      had brought from his conservatory. On my taking notice of its rich colour,
      he showed me a piece of paper round it, on which was written, “For the
      Father of the Marshalsea,” and presented it to me. But this was—hem—not
      all. He made a particular request, on taking leave, that I would remove
      the paper in half an hour. I—ha—I did so; and I found that it
      contained—ahem—two guineas. I assure you, Mr Clennam, I have
      received—hem—Testimonials in many ways, and of many degrees of
      value, and they have always been—ha—unfortunately acceptable;
      but I never was more pleased than with this—ahem—this
      particular Testimonial.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was in the act of saying the little he could say on such a theme,
      when a bell began to ring, and footsteps approached the door. A pretty
      girl of a far better figure and much more developed than Little Dorrit,
      though looking much younger in the face when the two were observed
      together, stopped in the doorway on seeing a stranger; and a young man who
      was with her, stopped too.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, Fanny. My eldest daughter and my son, Mr Clennam. The bell is
      a signal for visitors to retire, and so they have come to say good night;
      but there is plenty of time, plenty of time. Girls, Mr Clennam will excuse
      any household business you may have together. He knows, I dare say, that I
      have but one room here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I only want my clean dress from Amy, father,’ said the second girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I my clothes,’ said Tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amy opened a drawer in an old piece of furniture that was a chest of
      drawers above and a bedstead below, and produced two little bundles, which
      she handed to her brother and sister. ‘Mended and made up?’ Clennam heard
      the sister ask in a whisper. To which Amy answered ‘Yes.’ He had risen
      now, and took the opportunity of glancing round the room. The bare walls
      had been coloured green, evidently by an unskilled hand, and were poorly
      decorated with a few prints. The window was curtained, and the floor
      carpeted; and there were shelves and pegs, and other such conveniences,
      that had accumulated in the course of years. It was a close, confined
      room, poorly furnished; and the chimney smoked to boot, or the tin screen
      at the top of the fireplace was superfluous; but constant pains and care
      had made it neat, and even, after its kind, comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the while the bell was ringing, and the uncle was anxious to go.
      ‘Come, Fanny, come, Fanny,’ he said, with his ragged clarionet case under
      his arm; ‘the lock, child, the lock!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny bade her father good night, and whisked off airily. Tip had already
      clattered down-stairs. ‘Now, Mr Clennam,’ said the uncle, looking back as
      he shuffled out after them, ‘the lock, sir, the lock.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Clennam had two things to do before he followed; one, to offer his
      testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea, without giving pain to his
      child; the other to say something to that child, though it were but a
      word, in explanation of his having come there.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Allow me,’ said the Father, ‘to see you down-stairs.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had slipped out after the rest, and they were alone. ‘Not on any
      account,’ said the visitor, hurriedly. ‘Pray allow me to—’ chink,
      chink, chink.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam,’ said the Father, ‘I am deeply, deeply—’ But his
      visitor had shut up his hand to stop the clinking, and had gone
      down-stairs with great speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw no Little Dorrit on his way down, or in the yard. The last two or
      three stragglers were hurrying to the lodge, and he was following, when he
      caught sight of her in the doorway of the first house from the entrance.
      He turned back hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray forgive me,’ he said, ‘for speaking to you here; pray forgive me for
      coming here at all! I followed you to-night. I did so, that I might
      endeavour to render you and your family some service. You know the terms
      on which I and my mother are, and may not be surprised that I have
      preserved our distant relations at her house, lest I should
      unintentionally make her jealous, or resentful, or do you any injury in
      her estimation. What I have seen here, in this short time, has greatly
      increased my heartfelt wish to be a friend to you. It would recompense me
      for much disappointment if I could hope to gain your confidence.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was scared at first, but seemed to take courage while he spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are very good, sir. You speak very earnestly to me. But I—but I
      wish you had not watched me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood the emotion with which she said it, to arise in her father’s
      behalf; and he respected it, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Clennam has been of great service to me; I don’t know what we should
      have done without the employment she has given me; I am afraid it may not
      be a good return to become secret with her; I can say no more to-night,
      sir. I am sure you mean to be kind to us. Thank you, thank you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let me ask you one question before I leave. Have you known my mother
      long?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think two years, sir,—The bell has stopped.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How did you know her first? Did she send here for you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. She does not even know that I live here. We have a friend, father and
      I—a poor labouring man, but the best of friends—and I wrote
      out that I wished to do needlework, and gave his address. And he got what
      I wrote out displayed at a few places where it cost nothing, and Mrs
      Clennam found me that way, and sent for me. The gate will be locked, sir!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so tremulous and agitated, and he was so moved by compassion for
      her, and by deep interest in her story as it dawned upon him, that he
      could scarcely tear himself away. But the stoppage of the bell, and the
      quiet in the prison, were a warning to depart; and with a few hurried
      words of kindness he left her gliding back to her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he remained too late. The inner gate was locked, and the lodge closed.
      After a little fruitless knocking with his hand, he was standing there
      with the disagreeable conviction upon him that he had got to get through
      the night, when a voice accosted him from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Caught, eh?’ said the voice. ‘You won’t go home till morning. Oh! It’s
      you, is it, Mr Clennam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was Tip’s; and they stood looking at one another in the
      prison-yard, as it began to rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’ve done it,’ observed Tip; ‘you must be sharper than that next time.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But you are locked in too,’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I believe I am!’ said Tip, sarcastically. ‘About! But not in your way. I
      belong to the shop, only my sister has a theory that our governor must
      never know it. I don’t see why, myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can I get any shelter?’ asked Arthur. ‘What had I better do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We had better get hold of Amy first of all,’ said Tip, referring any
      difficulty to her as a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I would rather walk about all night—it’s not much to do—than
      give that trouble.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You needn’t do that, if you don’t mind paying for a bed. If you don’t
      mind paying, they’ll make you up one on the Snuggery table, under the
      circumstances. If you’ll come along, I’ll introduce you there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed down the yard, Arthur looked up at the window of the room
      he had lately left, where the light was still burning. ‘Yes, sir,’ said
      Tip, following his glance. ‘That’s the governor’s. She’ll sit with him for
      another hour reading yesterday’s paper to him, or something of that sort;
      and then she’ll come out like a little ghost, and vanish away without a
      sound.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t understand you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The governor sleeps up in the room, and she has a lodging at the
      turnkey’s. First house there,’ said Tip, pointing out the doorway into
      which she had retired. ‘First house, sky parlour. She pays twice as much
      for it as she would for one twice as good outside. But she stands by the
      governor, poor dear girl, day and night.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This brought them to the tavern-establishment at the upper end of the
      prison, where the collegians had just vacated their social evening club.
      The apartment on the ground-floor in which it was held, was the Snuggery
      in question; the presidential tribune of the chairman, the pewter-pots,
      glasses, pipes, tobacco-ashes, and general flavour of members, were still
      as that convivial institution had left them on its adjournment. The
      Snuggery had two of the qualities popularly held to be essential to grog
      for ladies, in respect that it was hot and strong; but in the third point
      of analogy, requiring plenty of it, the Snuggery was defective; being but
      a cooped-up apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unaccustomed visitor from outside, naturally assumed everybody here to
      be prisoners—landlord, waiter, barmaid, potboy, and all. Whether
      they were or not, did not appear; but they all had a weedy look. The
      keeper of a chandler’s shop in a front parlour, who took in gentlemen
      boarders, lent his assistance in making the bed. He had been a tailor in
      his time, and had kept a phaeton, he said. He boasted that he stood up
      litigiously for the interests of the college; and he had undefined and
      undefinable ideas that the marshal intercepted a ‘Fund,’ which ought to
      come to the collegians. He liked to believe this, and always impressed the
      shadowy grievance on new-comers and strangers; though he could not, for
      his life, have explained what Fund he meant, or how the notion had got
      rooted in his soul. He had fully convinced himself, notwithstanding, that
      his own proper share of the Fund was three and ninepence a week; and that
      in this amount he, as an individual collegian, was swindled by the
      marshal, regularly every Monday. Apparently, he helped to make the bed,
      that he might not lose an opportunity of stating this case; after which
      unloading of his mind, and after announcing (as it seemed he always did,
      without anything coming of it) that he was going to write a letter to the
      papers and show the marshal up, he fell into miscellaneous conversation
      with the rest. It was evident from the general tone of the whole party,
      that they had come to regard insolvency as the normal state of mankind,
      and the payment of debts as a disease that occasionally broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this strange scene, and with these strange spectres flitting about him,
      Arthur Clennam looked on at the preparations as if they were part of a
      dream. Pending which, the long-initiated Tip, with an awful enjoyment of
      the Snuggery’s resources, pointed out the common kitchen fire maintained
      by subscription of collegians, the boiler for hot water supported in like
      manner, and other premises generally tending to the deduction that the way
      to be healthy, wealthy, and wise, was to come to the Marshalsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two tables put together in a corner, were, at length, converted into a
      very fair bed; and the stranger was left to the Windsor chairs, the
      presidential tribune, the beery atmosphere, sawdust, pipe-lights,
      spittoons and repose. But the last item was long, long, long, in linking
      itself to the rest. The novelty of the place, the coming upon it without
      preparation, the sense of being locked up, the remembrance of that room
      up-stairs, of the two brothers, and above all of the retiring childish
      form, and the face in which he now saw years of insufficient food, if not
      of want, kept him waking and unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speculations, too, bearing the strangest relations towards the prison, but
      always concerning the prison, ran like nightmares through his mind while
      he lay awake. Whether coffins were kept ready for people who might die
      there, where they were kept, how they were kept, where people who died in
      the prison were buried, how they were taken out, what forms were observed,
      whether an implacable creditor could arrest the dead? As to escaping, what
      chances there were of escape? Whether a prisoner could scale the walls
      with a cord and grapple, how he would descend upon the other side? whether
      he could alight on a housetop, steal down a staircase, let himself out at
      a door, and get lost in the crowd? As to Fire in the prison, if one were
      to break out while he lay there?
    </p>
    <p>
      And these involuntary starts of fancy were, after all, but the setting of
      a picture in which three people kept before him. His father, with the
      steadfast look with which he had died, prophetically darkened forth in the
      portrait; his mother, with her arm up, warding off his suspicion; Little
      Dorrit, with her hand on the degraded arm, and her drooping head turned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      What if his mother had an old reason she well knew for softening to this
      poor girl! What if the prisoner now sleeping quietly—Heaven grant
      it!—by the light of the great Day of judgment should trace back his
      fall to her. What if any act of hers and of his father’s, should have even
      remotely brought the grey heads of those two brothers so low!
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift thought shot into his mind. In that long imprisonment here, and in
      her own long confinement to her room, did his mother find a balance to be
      struck? ‘I admit that I was accessory to that man’s captivity. I have
      suffered for it in kind. He has decayed in his prison: I in mine. I have
      paid the penalty.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When all the other thoughts had faded out, this one held possession of
      him. When he fell asleep, she came before him in her wheeled chair,
      warding him off with this justification. When he awoke, and sprang up
      causelessly frightened, the words were in his ears, as if her voice had
      slowly spoken them at his pillow, to break his rest: ‘He withers away in
      his prison; I wither away in mine; inexorable justice is done; what do I
      owe on this score!’

<p>The morning light was in no hurry to climb the prison wall and look in at
      the Snuggery windows; and when it did come, it would have been more
      welcome if it had come alone, instead of bringing a rush of rain with it.
      But the equinoctial gales were blowing out at sea, and the impartial
      south-west wind, in its flight, would not neglect even the narrow
      Marshalsea. While it roared through the steeple of St George’s Church, and
      twirled all the cowls in the neighbourhood, it made a swoop to beat the
      Southwark smoke into the jail; and, plunging down the chimneys of the few
      early collegians who were yet lighting their fires, half suffocated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam would have been little disposed to linger in bed, though
      his bed had been in a more private situation, and less affected by the
      raking out of yesterday’s fire, the kindling of to-day’s under the
      collegiate boiler, the filling of that Spartan vessel at the pump, the
      sweeping and sawdusting of the common room, and other such preparations.
      Heartily glad to see the morning, though little rested by the night, he
      turned out as soon as he could distinguish objects about him, and paced
      the yard for two heavy hours before the gate was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls were so near to one another, and the wild clouds hurried over
      them so fast, that it gave him a sensation like the beginning of
      sea-sickness to look up at the gusty sky. The rain, carried aslant by
      flaws of wind, blackened that side of the central building which he had
      visited last night, but left a narrow dry trough under the lee of the
      wall, where he walked up and down among the waits of straw and dust and
      paper, the waste droppings of the pump, and the stray leaves of
      yesterday’s greens. It was as haggard a view of life as a man need look
      upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was it relieved by any glimpse of the little creature who had brought
      him there. Perhaps she glided out of her doorway and in at that where her
      father lived, while his face was turned from both; but he saw nothing of
      her. It was too early for her brother; to have seen him once, was to have
      seen enough of him to know that he would be sluggish to leave whatever
      frowsy bed he occupied at night; so, as Arthur Clennam walked up and down,
      waiting for the gate to open, he cast about in his mind for future rather
      than for present means of pursuing his discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the lodge-gate turned, and the turnkey, standing on the step,
      taking an early comb at his hair, was ready to let him out. With a joyful
      sense of release he passed through the lodge, and found himself again in
      the little outer court-yard where he had spoken to the brother last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a string of people already straggling in, whom it was not
      difficult to identify as the nondescript messengers, go-betweens, and
      errand-bearers of the place. Some of them had been lounging in the rain
      until the gate should open; others, who had timed their arrival with
      greater nicety, were coming up now, and passing in with damp whitey-brown
      paper bags from the grocers, loaves of bread, lumps of butter, eggs, milk,
      and the like. The shabbiness of these attendants upon shabbiness, the
      poverty of these insolvent waiters upon insolvency, was a sight to see.
      Such threadbare coats and trousers, such fusty gowns and shawls, such
      squashed hats and bonnets, such boots and shoes, such umbrellas and
      walking-sticks, never were seen in Rag Fair. All of them wore the cast-off
      clothes of other men and women, were made up of patches and pieces of
      other people’s individuality, and had no sartorial existence of their own
      proper. Their walk was the walk of a race apart. They had a peculiar way
      of doggedly slinking round the corner, as if they were eternally going to
      the pawnbroker’s. When they coughed, they coughed like people accustomed
      to be forgotten on doorsteps and in draughty passages, waiting for answers
      to letters in faded ink, which gave the recipients of those manuscripts
      great mental disturbance and no satisfaction. As they eyed the stranger in
      passing, they eyed him with borrowing eyes—hungry, sharp,
      speculative as to his softness if they were accredited to him, and the
      likelihood of his standing something handsome. Mendicity on commission
      stooped in their high shoulders, shambled in their unsteady legs, buttoned
      and pinned and darned and dragged their clothes, frayed their
      button-holes, leaked out of their figures in dirty little ends of tape,
      and issued from their mouths in alcoholic breathings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As these people passed him standing still in the court-yard, and one of
      them turned back to inquire if he could assist him with his services, it
      came into Arthur Clennam’s mind that he would speak to Little Dorrit again
      before he went away. She would have recovered her first surprise, and
      might feel easier with him. He asked this member of the fraternity (who
      had two red herrings in his hand, and a loaf and a blacking brush under
      his arm), where was the nearest place to get a cup of coffee at. The
      nondescript replied in encouraging terms, and brought him to a coffee-shop
      in the street within a stone’s throw.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you know Miss Dorrit?’ asked the new client.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nondescript knew two Miss Dorrits; one who was born inside—That
      was the one! That was the one? The nondescript had known her many years.
      In regard of the other Miss Dorrit, the nondescript lodged in the same
      house with herself and uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      This changed the client’s half-formed design of remaining at the
      coffee-shop until the nondescript should bring him word that Dorrit had
      issued forth into the street. He entrusted the nondescript with a
      confidential message to her, importing that the visitor who had waited on
      her father last night, begged the favour of a few words with her at her
      uncle’s lodging; he obtained from the same source full directions to the
      house, which was very near; dismissed the nondescript gratified with
      half-a-crown; and having hastily refreshed himself at the coffee-shop,
      repaired with all speed to the clarionet-player’s dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were so many lodgers in this house that the doorpost seemed to be as
      full of bell-handles as a cathedral organ is of stops. Doubtful which
      might be the clarionet-stop, he was considering the point, when a
      shuttlecock flew out of the parlour window, and alighted on his hat. He
      then observed that in the parlour window was a blind with the inscription,
      MR CRIPPLES’s ACADEMY; also in another line, EVENING TUITION; and behind
      the blind was a little white-faced boy, with a slice of bread-and-butter
      and a battledore. The window being accessible from the footway, he looked
      in over the blind, returned the shuttlecock, and put his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dorrit?’ said the little white-faced boy (Master Cripples in fact). ‘<i>Mr</i>
      Dorrit? Third bell and one knock.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The pupils of Mr Cripples appeared to have been making a copy-book of the
      street-door, it was so extensively scribbled over in pencil. The frequency
      of the inscriptions, ‘Old Dorrit,’ and ‘Dirty Dick,’ in combination,
      suggested intentions of personality on the part Of Mr Cripples’s pupils.
      There was ample time to make these observations before the door was opened
      by the poor old man himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ha!’ said he, very slowly remembering Arthur, ‘you were shut in last
      night?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Mr Dorrit. I hope to meet your niece here presently.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ said he, pondering. ‘Out of my brother’s way? True. Would you come
      up-stairs and wait for her?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning himself as slowly as he turned in his mind whatever he heard or
      said, he led the way up the narrow stairs. The house was very close, and
      had an unwholesome smell. The little staircase windows looked in at the
      back windows of other houses as unwholesome as itself, with poles and
      lines thrust out of them, on which unsightly linen hung; as if the
      inhabitants were angling for clothes, and had had some wretched bites not
      worth attending to. In the back garret—a sickly room, with a turn-up
      bedstead in it, so hastily and recently turned up that the blankets were
      boiling over, as it were, and keeping the lid open—a half-finished
      breakfast of coffee and toast for two persons was jumbled down anyhow on a
      rickety table.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one there. The old man mumbling to himself, after some
      consideration, that Fanny had run away, went to the next room to fetch her
      back. The visitor, observing that she held the door on the inside, and
      that, when the uncle tried to open it, there was a sharp adjuration of
      ‘Don’t, stupid!’ and an appearance of loose stocking and flannel,
      concluded that the young lady was in an undress. The uncle, without
      appearing to come to any conclusion, shuffled in again, sat down in his
      chair, and began warming his hands at the fire; not that it was cold, or
      that he had any waking idea whether it was or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What did you think of my brother, sir?’ he asked, when he by-and-by
      discovered what he was doing, left off, reached over to the chimney-piece,
      and took his clarionet case down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was glad,’ said Arthur, very much at a loss, for his thoughts were on
      the brother before him; ‘to find him so well and cheerful.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ha!’ muttered the old man, ‘yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur wondered what he could possibly want with the clarionet case. He
      did not want it at all. He discovered, in due time, that it was not the
      little paper of snuff (which was also on the chimney-piece), put it back
      again, took down the snuff instead, and solaced himself with a pinch. He
      was as feeble, spare, and slow in his pinches as in everything else, but a
      certain little trickling of enjoyment of them played in the poor worn
      nerves about the corners of his eyes and mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy, Mr Clennam. What do you think of her?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am much impressed, Mr Dorrit, by all that I have seen of her and
      thought of her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My brother would have been quite lost without Amy,’ he returned. ‘We
      should all have been lost without Amy. She is a very good girl, Amy. She
      does her duty.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur fancied that he heard in these praises a certain tone of custom,
      which he had heard from the father last night with an inward protest and
      feeling of antagonism. It was not that they stinted her praises, or were
      insensible to what she did for them; but that they were lazily habituated
      to her, as they were to all the rest of their condition. He fancied that
      although they had before them, every day, the means of comparison between
      her and one another and themselves, they regarded her as being in her
      necessary place; as holding a position towards them all which belonged to
      her, like her name or her age. He fancied that they viewed her, not as
      having risen away from the prison atmosphere, but as appertaining to it;
      as being vaguely what they had a right to expect, and nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her uncle resumed his breakfast, and was munching toast sopped in coffee,
      oblivious of his guest, when the third bell rang. That was Amy, he said,
      and went down to let her in; leaving the visitor with as vivid a picture
      on his mind of his begrimed hands, dirt-worn face, and decayed figure, as
      if he were still drooping in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came up after him, in the usual plain dress, and with the usual timid
      manner. Her lips were a little parted, as if her heart beat faster than
      usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, Amy,’ said her uncle, ‘has been expecting you some time.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I took the liberty of sending you a message.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I received the message, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you going to my mother’s this morning? I think not, for it is past
      your usual hour.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not to-day, sir. I am not wanted to-day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you allow Me to walk a little way in whatever direction you may be
      going? I can then speak to you as we walk, both without detaining you
      here, and without intruding longer here myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked embarrassed, but said, if he pleased. He made a pretence of
      having mislaid his walking-stick, to give her time to set the bedstead
      right, to answer her sister’s impatient knock at the wall, and to say a
      word softly to her uncle. Then he found it, and they went down-stairs; she
      first, he following; the uncle standing at the stair-head, and probably
      forgetting them before they had reached the ground floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Cripples’s pupils, who were by this time coming to school, desisted
      from their morning recreation of cuffing one another with bags and books,
      to stare with all the eyes they had at a stranger who had been to see
      Dirty Dick. They bore the trying spectacle in silence, until the
      mysterious visitor was at a safe distance; when they burst into pebbles
      and yells, and likewise into reviling dances, and in all respects buried
      the pipe of peace with so many savage ceremonies, that, if Mr Cripples had
      been the chief of the Cripplewayboo tribe with his war-paint on, they
      could scarcely have done greater justice to their education.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of this homage, Mr Arthur Clennam offered his arm to Little
      Dorrit, and Little Dorrit took it. ‘Will you go by the Iron Bridge,’ said
      he, ‘where there is an escape from the noise of the street?’ Little Dorrit
      answered, if he pleased, and presently ventured to hope that he would ‘not
      mind’ Mr Cripples’s boys, for she had herself received her education, such
      as it was, in Mr Cripples’s evening academy. He returned, with the best
      will in the world, that Mr Cripples’s boys were forgiven out of the bottom
      of his soul. Thus did Cripples unconsciously become a master of the
      ceremonies between them, and bring them more naturally together than Beau
      Nash might have done if they had lived in his golden days, and he had
      alighted from his coach and six for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning remained squally, and the streets were miserably muddy, but no
      rain fell as they walked towards the Iron Bridge. The little creature
      seemed so young in his eyes, that there were moments when he found himself
      thinking of her, if not speaking to her, as if she were a child. Perhaps
      he seemed as old in her eyes as she seemed young in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sorry to hear you were so inconvenienced last night, sir, as to be
      locked in. It was very unfortunate.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nothing, he returned. He had had a very good bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes!’ she said quickly; ‘she believed there were excellent beds at the
      coffee-house.’ He noticed that the coffee-house was quite a majestic hotel
      to her, and that she treasured its reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I believe it is very expensive,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘but my father has
      told me that quite beautiful dinners may be got there. And wine,’ she
      added timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Were you ever there?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh no! Only into the kitchen to fetch hot water.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To think of growing up with a kind of awe upon one as to the luxuries of
      that superb establishment, the Marshalsea Hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I asked you last night,’ said Clennam, ‘how you had become acquainted
      with my mother. Did you ever hear her name before she sent for you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you think your father ever did?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He met her eyes raised to his with so much wonder in them (she was scared
      when the encounter took place, and shrunk away again), that he felt it
      necessary to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have a reason for asking, which I cannot very well explain; but you
      must, on no account, suppose it to be of a nature to cause you the least
      alarm or anxiety. Quite the reverse. And you think that at no time of your
      father’s life was my name of Clennam ever familiar to him?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, from the tone in which she spoke, that she was glancing up at him
      with those parted lips; therefore he looked before him, rather than make
      her heart beat quicker still by embarrassing her afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they emerged upon the Iron Bridge, which was as quiet after the
      roaring streets as though it had been open country. The wind blew roughly,
      the wet squalls came rattling past them, skimming the pools on the road
      and pavement, and raining them down into the river. The clouds raced on
      furiously in the lead-coloured sky, the smoke and mist raced after them,
      the dark tide ran fierce and strong in the same direction. Little Dorrit
      seemed the least, the quietest, and weakest of Heaven’s creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let me put you in a coach,’ said Clennam, very nearly adding ‘my poor
      child.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurriedly declined, saying that wet or dry made little difference to
      her; she was used to go about in all weathers. He knew it to be so, and
      was touched with more pity; thinking of the slight figure at his side,
      making its nightly way through the damp dark boisterous streets to such a
      place of rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You spoke so feelingly to me last night, sir, and I found afterwards that
      you had been so generous to my father, that I could not resist your
      message, if it was only to thank you; especially as I wished very much to
      say to you—’ she hesitated and trembled, and tears rose in her eyes,
      but did not fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To say to me—?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That I hope you will not misunderstand my father. Don’t judge him, sir,
      as you would judge others outside the gates. He has been there so long! I
      never saw him outside, but I can understand that he must have grown
      different in some things since.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My thoughts will never be unjust or harsh towards him, believe me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not,’ she said, with a prouder air, as the misgiving evidently crept upon
      her that she might seem to be abandoning him, ‘not that he has anything to
      be ashamed of for himself, or that I have anything to be ashamed of for
      him. He only requires to be understood. I only ask for him that his life
      may be fairly remembered. All that he said was quite true. It all happened
      just as he related it. He is very much respected. Everybody who comes in,
      is glad to know him. He is more courted than anyone else. He is far more
      thought of than the Marshal is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever pride were innocent, it was innocent in Little Dorrit when she
      grew boastful of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is often said that his manners are a true gentleman’s, and quite a
      study. I see none like them in that place, but he is admitted to be
      superior to all the rest. This is quite as much why they make him
      presents, as because they know him to be needy. He is not to be blamed for
      being in need, poor love. Who could be in prison a quarter of a century,
      and be prosperous!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      What affection in her words, what compassion in her repressed tears, what
      a great soul of fidelity within her, how true the light that shed false
      brightness round him!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I have found it best to conceal where my home is, it is not because I
      am ashamed of him. God forbid! Nor am I so much ashamed of the place
      itself as might be supposed. People are not bad because they come there. I
      have known numbers of good, persevering, honest people come there through
      misfortune. They are almost all kind-hearted to one another. And it would
      be ungrateful indeed in me, to forget that I have had many quiet,
      comfortable hours there; that I had an excellent friend there when I was
      quite a baby, who was very very fond of me; that I have been taught there,
      and have worked there, and have slept soundly there. I think it would be
      almost cowardly and cruel not to have some little attachment for it, after
      all this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had relieved the faithful fulness of her heart, and modestly said,
      raising her eyes appealingly to her new friend’s, ‘I did not mean to say
      so much, nor have I ever but once spoken about this before. But it seems
      to set it more right than it was last night. I said I wished you had not
      followed me, sir. I don’t wish it so much now, unless you should think—indeed
      I don’t wish it at all, unless I should have spoken so confusedly, that—that
      you can scarcely understand me, which I am afraid may be the case.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her with perfect truth that it was not the case; and putting
      himself between her and the sharp wind and rain, sheltered her as well as
      he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I feel permitted now,’ he said, ‘to ask you a little more concerning your
      father. Has he many creditors?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! a great number.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I mean detaining creditors, who keep him where he is?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes! a great number.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can you tell me—I can get the information, no doubt, elsewhere, if
      you cannot—who is the most influential of them?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit said, after considering a little, that she used to hear long
      ago of Mr Tite Barnacle as a man of great power. He was a commissioner, or
      a board, or a trustee, ‘or something.’ He lived in Grosvenor Square, she
      thought, or very near it. He was under Government—high in the
      Circumlocution Office. She appeared to have acquired, in her infancy, some
      awful impression of the might of this formidable Mr Tite Barnacle of
      Grosvenor Square, or very near it, and the Circumlocution Office, which
      quite crushed her when she mentioned him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It can do no harm,’ thought Arthur, ‘if I see this Mr Tite Barnacle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought did not present itself so quietly but that her quickness
      intercepted it. ‘Ah!’ said Little Dorrit, shaking her head with the mild
      despair of a lifetime. ‘Many people used to think once of getting my poor
      father out, but you don’t know how hopeless it is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She forgot to be shy at the moment, in honestly warning him away from the
      sunken wreck he had a dream of raising; and looked at him with eyes which
      assuredly, in association with her patient face, her fragile figure, her
      spare dress, and the wind and rain, did not turn him from his purpose of
      helping her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Even if it could be done,’ said she—‘and it never can be done now—where
      could father live, or how could he live? I have often thought that if such
      a change could come, it might be anything but a service to him now. People
      might not think so well of him outside as they do there. He might not be
      so gently dealt with outside as he is there. He might not be so fit
      himself for the life outside as he is for that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here for the first time she could not restrain her tears from falling; and
      the little thin hands he had watched when they were so busy, trembled as
      they clasped each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It would be a new distress to him even to know that I earn a little
      money, and that Fanny earns a little money. He is so anxious about us, you
      see, feeling helplessly shut up there. Such a good, good father!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He let the little burst of feeling go by before he spoke. It was soon
      gone. She was not accustomed to think of herself, or to trouble any one
      with her emotions. He had but glanced away at the piles of city roofs and
      chimneys among which the smoke was rolling heavily, and at the wilderness
      of masts on the river, and the wilderness of steeples on the shore,
      indistinctly mixed together in the stormy haze, when she was again as
      quiet as if she had been plying her needle in his mother’s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You would be glad to have your brother set at liberty?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh very, very glad, sir!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, we will hope for him at least. You told me last night of a friend
      you had?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His name was Plornish, Little Dorrit said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And where did Plornish live? Plornish lived in Bleeding Heart Yard. He was
      ‘only a plasterer,’ Little Dorrit said, as a caution to him not to form
      high social expectations of Plornish. He lived at the last house in
      Bleeding Heart Yard, and his name was over a little gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur took down the address and gave her his. He had now done all he
      sought to do for the present, except that he wished to leave her with a
      reliance upon him, and to have something like a promise from her that she
      would cherish it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There is one friend!’ he said, putting up his pocketbook. ‘As I take you
      back—you are going back?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes! going straight home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—As I take you back,’ the word home jarred upon him, ‘let me ask
      you to persuade yourself that you have another friend. I make no
      professions, and say no more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are truly kind to me, sir. I am sure I need no more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked back through the miserable muddy streets, and among the poor,
      mean shops, and were jostled by the crowds of dirty hucksters usual to a
      poor neighbourhood. There was nothing, by the short way, that was pleasant
      to any of the five senses. Yet it was not a common passage through common
      rain, and mire, and noise, to Clennam, having this little, slender,
      careful creature on his arm. How young she seemed to him, or how old he to
      her; or what a secret either to the other, in that beginning of the
      destined interweaving of their stories, matters not here. He thought of
      her having been born and bred among these scenes, and shrinking through
      them now, familiar yet misplaced; he thought of her long acquaintance with
      the squalid needs of life, and of her innocence; of her solicitude for
      others, and her few years, and her childish aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were come into the High Street, where the prison stood, when a voice
      cried, ‘Little mother, little mother!’ Little Dorrit stopping and looking
      back, an excited figure of a strange kind bounced against them (still
      crying ‘little mother’), fell down, and scattered the contents of a large
      basket, filled with potatoes, in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Maggy,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘what a clumsy child you are!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggy was not hurt, but picked herself up immediately, and then began to
      pick up the potatoes, in which both Little Dorrit and Arthur Clennam
      helped. Maggy picked up very few potatoes and a great quantity of mud; but
      they were all recovered, and deposited in the basket. Maggy then smeared
      her muddy face with her shawl, and presenting it to Mr Clennam as a type
      of purity, enabled him to see what she was like.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about eight-and-twenty, with large bones, large features, large
      feet and hands, large eyes and no hair. Her large eyes were limpid and
      almost colourless; they seemed to be very little affected by light, and to
      stand unnaturally still. There was also that attentive listening
      expression in her face, which is seen in the faces of the blind; but she
      was not blind, having one tolerably serviceable eye. Her face was not
      exceedingly ugly, though it was only redeemed from being so by a smile; a
      good-humoured smile, and pleasant in itself, but rendered pitiable by
      being constantly there. A great white cap, with a quantity of opaque
      frilling that was always flapping about, apologised for Maggy’s baldness,
      and made it so very difficult for her old black bonnet to retain its place
      upon her head, that it held on round her neck like a gipsy’s baby. A
      commission of haberdashers could alone have reported what the rest of her
      poor dress was made of, but it had a strong general resemblance to
      seaweed, with here and there a gigantic tea-leaf. Her shawl looked
      particularly like a tea-leaf after long infusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam looked at Little Dorrit with the expression of one saying,
      ‘May I ask who this is?’ Little Dorrit, whose hand this Maggy, still
      calling her little mother, had begun to fondle, answered in words (they
      were under a gateway into which the majority of the potatoes had rolled).
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is Maggy, sir.’ 
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0106m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0106m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0106.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      ‘Maggy, sir,’ echoed the personage presented. ‘Little mother!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is the grand-daughter—’ said Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Grand-daughter,’ echoed Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of my old nurse, who has been dead a long time. Maggy, how old are you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ten, mother,’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can’t think how good she is, sir,’ said Little Dorrit, with infinite
      tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good <i>she</i> is,’ echoed Maggy, transferring the pronoun in a most
      expressive way from herself to her little mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Or how clever,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘She goes on errands as well as any
      one.’ Maggy laughed. ‘And is as trustworthy as the Bank of England.’ Maggy
      laughed. ‘She earns her own living entirely. Entirely, sir!’ said Little
      Dorrit, in a lower and triumphant tone. ‘Really does!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is her history?’ asked Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Think of that, Maggy?’ said Little Dorrit, taking her two large hands and
      clapping them together. ‘A gentleman from thousands of miles away, wanting
      to know your history!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>My</i> history?’ cried Maggy. ‘Little mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She means me,’ said Little Dorrit, rather confused; ‘she is very much
      attached to me. Her old grandmother was not so kind to her as she should
      have been; was she, Maggy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggy shook her head, made a drinking vessel of her clenched left hand,
      drank out of it, and said, ‘Gin.’ Then beat an imaginary child, and said,
      ‘Broom-handles and pokers.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When Maggy was ten years old,’ said Little Dorrit, watching her face
      while she spoke, ‘she had a bad fever, sir, and she has never grown any
      older ever since.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ten years old,’ said Maggy, nodding her head. ‘But what a nice hospital!
      So comfortable, wasn’t it? Oh so nice it was. Such a Ev’nly place!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She had never been at peace before, sir,’ said Little Dorrit, turning
      towards Arthur for an instant and speaking low, ‘and she always runs off
      upon that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Such beds there is there!’ cried Maggy. ‘Such lemonades! Such oranges!
      Such d’licious broth and wine! Such Chicking! Oh, AIN’T it a delightful
      place to go and stop at!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So Maggy stopped there as long as she could,’ said Little Dorrit, in her
      former tone of telling a child’s story; the tone designed for Maggy’s ear,
      ‘and at last, when she could stop there no longer, she came out. Then,
      because she was never to be more than ten years old, however long she
      lived—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘However long she lived,’ echoed Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—And because she was very weak; indeed was so weak that when she
      began to laugh she couldn’t stop herself—which was a great pity—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Maggy mighty grave of a sudden.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—Her grandmother did not know what to do with her, and for some
      years was very unkind to her indeed. At length, in course of time, Maggy
      began to take pains to improve herself, and to be very attentive and very
      industrious; and by degrees was allowed to come in and out as often as she
      liked, and got enough to do to support herself, and does support herself.
      And that,’ said Little Dorrit, clapping the two great hands together
      again, ‘is Maggy’s history, as Maggy knows!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! But Arthur would have known what was wanting to its completeness,
      though he had never heard of the words Little mother; though he had never
      seen the fondling of the small spare hand; though he had had no sight for
      the tears now standing in the colourless eyes; though he had had no
      hearing for the sob that checked the clumsy laugh. The dirty gateway with
      the wind and rain whistling through it, and the basket of muddy potatoes
      waiting to be spilt again or taken up, never seemed the common hole it
      really was, when he looked back to it by these lights. Never, never!
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very near the end of their walk, and they now came out of the
      gateway to finish it. Nothing would serve Maggy but that they must stop at
      a grocer’s window, short of their destination, for her to show her
      learning. She could read after a sort; and picked out the fat figures in
      the tickets of prices, for the most part correctly. She also stumbled,
      with a large balance of success against her failures, through various
      philanthropic recommendations to Try our Mixture, Try our Family Black,
      Try our Orange-flavoured Pekoe, challenging competition at the head of
      Flowery Teas; and various cautions to the public against spurious
      establishments and adulterated articles. When he saw how pleasure brought
      a rosy tint into Little Dorrit’s face when Maggy made a hit, he felt that
      he could have stood there making a library of the grocer’s window until
      the rain and wind were tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court-yard received them at last, and there he said goodbye to Little
      Dorrit. Little as she had always looked, she looked less than ever when he
      saw her going into the Marshalsea lodge passage, the little mother
      attended by her big child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cage door opened, and when the small bird, reared in captivity, had
      tamely fluttered in, he saw it shut again; and then he came away.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Containing the whole Science of Government</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>The Circumlocution Office was (as everybody knows without being told) the
      most important Department under Government. No public business of any kind
      could possibly be done at any time without the acquiescence of the
      Circumlocution Office. Its finger was in the largest public pie, and in
      the smallest public tart. It was equally impossible to do the plainest
      right and to undo the plainest wrong without the express authority of the
      Circumlocution Office. If another Gunpowder Plot had been discovered half
      an hour before the lighting of the match, nobody would have been justified
      in saving the parliament until there had been half a score of boards, half
      a bushel of minutes, several sacks of official memoranda, and a
      family-vault full of ungrammatical correspondence, on the part of the
      Circumlocution Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      This glorious establishment had been early in the field, when the one
      sublime principle involving the difficult art of governing a country, was
      first distinctly revealed to statesmen. It had been foremost to study that
      bright revelation and to carry its shining influence through the whole of
      the official proceedings. Whatever was required to be done, the
      Circumlocution Office was beforehand with all the public departments in
      the art of perceiving—HOW NOT TO DO IT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this delicate perception, through the tact with which it
      invariably seized it, and through the genius with which it always acted on
      it, the Circumlocution Office had risen to overtop all the public
      departments; and the public condition had risen to be—what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that How not to do it was the great study and object of all
      public departments and professional politicians all round the
      Circumlocution Office. It is true that every new premier and every new
      government, coming in because they had upheld a certain thing as necessary
      to be done, were no sooner come in than they applied their utmost
      faculties to discovering How not to do it. It is true that from the moment
      when a general election was over, every returned man who had been raving
      on hustings because it hadn’t been done, and who had been asking the
      friends of the honourable gentleman in the opposite interest on pain of
      impeachment to tell him why it hadn’t been done, and who had been
      asserting that it must be done, and who had been pledging himself that it
      should be done, began to devise, How it was not to be done. It is true
      that the debates of both Houses of Parliament the whole session through,
      uniformly tended to the protracted deliberation, How not to do it. It is
      true that the royal speech at the opening of such session virtually said,
      My lords and gentlemen, you have a considerable stroke of work to do, and
      you will please to retire to your respective chambers, and discuss, How
      not to do it. It is true that the royal speech, at the close of such
      session, virtually said, My lords and gentlemen, you have through several
      laborious months been considering with great loyalty and patriotism, How
      not to do it, and you have found out; and with the blessing of Providence
      upon the harvest (natural, not political), I now dismiss you. All this is
      true, but the Circumlocution Office went beyond it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the Circumlocution Office went on mechanically, every day, keeping
      this wonderful, all-sufficient wheel of statesmanship, How not to do it,
      in motion. Because the Circumlocution Office was down upon any ill-advised
      public servant who was going to do it, or who appeared to be by any
      surprising accident in remote danger of doing it, with a minute, and a
      memorandum, and a letter of instructions that extinguished him. It was
      this spirit of national efficiency in the Circumlocution Office that had
      gradually led to its having something to do with everything. Mechanicians,
      natural philosophers, soldiers, sailors, petitioners, memorialists, people
      with grievances, people who wanted to prevent grievances, people who
      wanted to redress grievances, jobbing people, jobbed people, people who
      couldn’t get rewarded for merit, and people who couldn’t get punished for
      demerit, were all indiscriminately tucked up under the foolscap paper of
      the Circumlocution Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numbers of people were lost in the Circumlocution Office. Unfortunates
      with wrongs, or with projects for the general welfare (and they had better
      have had wrongs at first, than have taken that bitter English recipe for
      certainly getting them), who in slow lapse of time and agony had passed
      safely through other public departments; who, according to rule, had been
      bullied in this, over-reached by that, and evaded by the other; got
      referred at last to the Circumlocution Office, and never reappeared in the
      light of day. Boards sat upon them, secretaries minuted upon them,
      commissioners gabbled about them, clerks registered, entered, checked, and
      ticked them off, and they melted away. In short, all the business of the
      country went through the Circumlocution Office, except the business that
      never came out of it; and <i>its</i> name was Legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, angry spirits attacked the Circumlocution Office. Sometimes,
      parliamentary questions were asked about it, and even parliamentary
      motions made or threatened about it by demagogues so low and ignorant as
      to hold that the real recipe of government was, How to do it. Then would
      the noble lord, or right honourable gentleman, in whose department it was
      to defend the Circumlocution Office, put an orange in his pocket, and make
      a regular field-day of the occasion. Then would he come down to that house
      with a slap upon the table, and meet the honourable gentleman foot to
      foot. Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that the
      Circumlocution Office not only was blameless in this matter, but was
      commendable in this matter, was extollable to the skies in this matter.
      Then would he be there to tell that honourable gentleman that, although
      the Circumlocution Office was invariably right and wholly right, it never
      was so right as in this matter. Then would he be there to tell that
      honourable gentleman that it would have been more to his honour, more to
      his credit, more to his good taste, more to his good sense, more to half
      the dictionary of commonplaces, if he had left the Circumlocution Office
      alone, and never approached this matter. Then would he keep one eye upon a
      coach or crammer from the Circumlocution Office sitting below the bar, and
      smash the honourable gentleman with the Circumlocution Office account of
      this matter. And although one of two things always happened; namely,
      either that the Circumlocution Office had nothing to say and said it, or
      that it had something to say of which the noble lord, or right honourable
      gentleman, blundered one half and forgot the other; the Circumlocution
      Office was always voted immaculate by an accommodating majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a nursery of statesmen had the Department become in virtue of a long
      career of this nature, that several solemn lords had attained the
      reputation of being quite unearthly prodigies of business, solely from
      having practised, How not to do it, as the head of the Circumlocution
      Office. As to the minor priests and acolytes of that temple, the result of
      all this was that they stood divided into two classes, and, down to the
      junior messenger, either believed in the Circumlocution Office as a
      heaven-born institution that had an absolute right to do whatever it
      liked; or took refuge in total infidelity, and considered it a flagrant
      nuisance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Barnacle family had for some time helped to administer the
      Circumlocution Office. The Tite Barnacle Branch, indeed, considered
      themselves in a general way as having vested rights in that direction, and
      took it ill if any other family had much to say to it. The Barnacles were
      a very high family, and a very large family. They were dispersed all over
      the public offices, and held all sorts of public places. Either the nation
      was under a load of obligation to the Barnacles, or the Barnacles were
      under a load of obligation to the nation. It was not quite unanimously
      settled which; the Barnacles having their opinion, the nation theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mr Tite Barnacle who at the period now in question usually coached or
      crammed the statesman at the head of the Circumlocution Office, when that
      noble or right honourable individual sat a little uneasily in his saddle
      by reason of some vagabond making a tilt at him in a newspaper, was more
      flush of blood than money. As a Barnacle he had his place, which was a
      snug thing enough; and as a Barnacle he had of course put in his son
      Barnacle Junior in the office. But he had intermarried with a branch of
      the Stiltstalkings, who were also better endowed in a sanguineous point of
      view than with real or personal property, and of this marriage there had
      been issue, Barnacle junior and three young ladies. What with the
      patrician requirements of Barnacle junior, the three young ladies, Mrs
      Tite Barnacle nee Stiltstalking, and himself, Mr Tite Barnacle found the
      intervals between quarter day and quarter day rather longer than he could
      have desired; a circumstance which he always attributed to the country’s
      parsimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mr Tite Barnacle, Mr Arthur Clennam made his fifth inquiry one day at
      the Circumlocution Office; having on previous occasions awaited that
      gentleman successively in a hall, a glass case, a waiting room, and a
      fire-proof passage where the Department seemed to keep its wind. On this
      occasion Mr Barnacle was not engaged, as he had been before, with the
      noble prodigy at the head of the Department; but was absent. Barnacle
      Junior, however, was announced as a lesser star, yet visible above the
      office horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Barnacle junior, he signified his desire to confer; and found that
      young gentleman singeing the calves of his legs at the parental fire, and
      supporting his spine against the mantel-shelf. It was a comfortable room,
      handsomely furnished in the higher official manner; an presenting stately
      suggestions of the absent Barnacle, in the thick carpet, the
      leather-covered desk to sit at, the leather-covered desk to stand at, the
      formidable easy-chair and hearth-rug, the interposed screen, the torn-up
      papers, the dispatch-boxes with little labels sticking out of them, like
      medicine bottles or dead game, the pervading smell of leather and
      mahogany, and a general bamboozling air of How not to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Barnacle, holding Mr Clennam’s card in his hand, had a
      youthful aspect, and the fluffiest little whisker, perhaps, that ever was
      seen. Such a downy tip was on his callow chin, that he seemed half fledged
      like a young bird; and a compassionate observer might have urged that, if
      he had not singed the calves of his legs, he would have died of cold. He
      had a superior eye-glass dangling round his neck, but unfortunately had
      such flat orbits to his eyes and such limp little eyelids that it wouldn’t
      stick in when he put it up, but kept tumbling out against his waistcoat
      buttons with a click that discomposed him very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I say. Look here! My father’s not in the way, and won’t be in the way
      to-day,’ said Barnacle Junior. ‘Is this anything that I can do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Click! Eye-glass down. Barnacle Junior quite frightened and feeling all
      round himself, but not able to find it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are very good,’ said Arthur Clennam. ‘I wish however to see Mr
      Barnacle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I say. Look here! You haven’t got any appointment, you know,’ said
      Barnacle Junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      (By this time he had found the eye-glass, and put it up again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Arthur Clennam. ‘That is what I wish to have.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I say. Look here! Is this public business?’ asked Barnacle junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Click! Eye-glass down again. Barnacle Junior in that state of search
      after it that Mr Clennam felt it useless to reply at present.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it,’ said Barnacle junior, taking heed of his visitor’s brown face,
      ‘anything about—Tonnage—or that sort of thing?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Pausing for a reply, he opened his right eye with his hand, and stuck his
      glass in it, in that inflammatory manner that his eye began watering
      dreadfully.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Arthur, ‘it is nothing about tonnage.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then look here. Is it private business?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I really am not sure. It relates to a Mr Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Look here, I tell you what! You had better call at our house, if you are
      going that way. Twenty-four, Mews Street, Grosvenor Square. My father’s
      got a slight touch of the gout, and is kept at home by it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (The misguided young Barnacle evidently going blind on his eye-glass side,
      but ashamed to make any further alteration in his painful arrangements.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you. I will call there now. Good morning.’ Young Barnacle seemed
      discomfited at this, as not having at all expected him to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are quite sure,’ said Barnacle junior, calling after him when he got
      to the door, unwilling wholly to relinquish the bright business idea he
      had conceived; ‘that it’s nothing about Tonnage?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With such assurance, and rather wondering what might have taken place if
      it <i>had</i> been anything about tonnage, Mr Clennam withdrew to pursue
      his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mews Street, Grosvenor Square, was not absolutely Grosvenor Square itself,
      but it was very near it. It was a hideous little street of dead wall,
      stables, and dunghills, with lofts over coach-houses inhabited by
      coachmen’s families, who had a passion for drying clothes and decorating
      their window-sills with miniature turnpike-gates. The principal
      chimney-sweep of that fashionable quarter lived at the blind end of Mews
      Street; and the same corner contained an establishment much frequented
      about early morning and twilight for the purchase of wine-bottles and
      kitchen-stuff. Punch’s shows used to lean against the dead wall in Mews
      Street, while their proprietors were dining elsewhere; and the dogs of the
      neighbourhood made appointments to meet in the same locality. Yet there
      were two or three small airless houses at the entrance end of Mews Street,
      which went at enormous rents on account of their being abject hangers-on
      to a fashionable situation; and whenever one of these fearful little coops
      was to be let (which seldom happened, for they were in great request), the
      house agent advertised it as a gentlemanly residence in the most
      aristocratic part of town, inhabited solely by the elite of the beau
      monde.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a gentlemanly residence coming strictly within this narrow margin had
      not been essential to the blood of the Barnacles, this particular branch
      would have had a pretty wide selection among, let us say, ten thousand
      houses, offering fifty times the accommodation for a third of the money.
      As it was, Mr Barnacle, finding his gentlemanly residence extremely
      inconvenient and extremely dear, always laid it, as a public servant, at
      the door of the country, and adduced it as another instance of the
      country’s parsimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam came to a squeezed house, with a ramshackle bowed front,
      little dingy windows, and a little dark area like a damp waistcoat-pocket,
      which he found to be number twenty-four, Mews Street, Grosvenor Square. To
      the sense of smell the house was like a sort of bottle filled with a
      strong distillation of Mews; and when the footman opened the door, he
      seemed to take the stopper out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman was to the Grosvenor Square footmen, what the house was to the
      Grosvenor Square houses. Admirable in his way, his way was a back and a
      bye way. His gorgeousness was not unmixed with dirt; and both in
      complexion and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his
      pantry. A sallow flabbiness was upon him when he took the stopper out, and
      presented the bottle to Mr Clennam’s nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Be so good as to give that card to Mr Tite Barnacle, and to say that I
      have just now seen the younger Mr Barnacle, who recommended me to call
      here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman (who had as many large buttons with the Barnacle crest upon
      them on the flaps of his pockets, as if he were the family strong box, and
      carried the plate and jewels about with him buttoned up) pondered over the
      card a little; then said, ‘Walk in.’ It required some judgment to do it
      without butting the inner hall-door open, and in the consequent mental
      confusion and physical darkness slipping down the kitchen stairs. The
      visitor, however, brought himself up safely on the door-mat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the footman said ‘Walk in,’ so the visitor followed him. At the
      inner hall-door, another bottle seemed to be presented and another stopper
      taken out. This second vial appeared to be filled with concentrated
      provisions and extract of Sink from the pantry. After a skirmish in the
      narrow passage, occasioned by the footman’s opening the door of the dismal
      dining-room with confidence, finding some one there with consternation,
      and backing on the visitor with disorder, the visitor was shut up, pending
      his announcement, in a close back parlour. There he had an opportunity of
      refreshing himself with both the bottles at once, looking out at a low
      blinding wall three feet off, and speculating on the number of Barnacle
      families within the bills of mortality who lived in such hutches of their
      own free flunkey choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Barnacle would see him. Would he walk up-stairs? He would, and he did;
      and in the drawing-room, with his leg on a rest, he found Mr Barnacle
      himself, the express image and presentment of How not to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Barnacle dated from a better time, when the country was not so
      parsimonious and the Circumlocution Office was not so badgered. He wound
      and wound folds of white cravat round his neck, as he wound and wound
      folds of tape and paper round the neck of the country. His wristbands and
      collar were oppressive; his voice and manner were oppressive. He had a
      large watch-chain and bunch of seals, a coat buttoned up to inconvenience,
      a waistcoat buttoned up to inconvenience, an unwrinkled pair of trousers,
      a stiff pair of boots. He was altogether splendid, massive, overpowering,
      and impracticable. He seemed to have been sitting for his portrait to Sir
      Thomas Lawrence all the days of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam?’ said Mr Barnacle. ‘Be seated.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Clennam became seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have called on me, I believe,’ said Mr Barnacle, ‘at the
      Circumlocution—’ giving it the air of a word of about
      five-and-twenty syllables—‘Office.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have taken that liberty.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Barnacle solemnly bent his head as who should say, ‘I do not deny that
      it is a liberty; proceed to take another liberty, and let me know your
      business.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Allow me to observe that I have been for some years in China, am quite a
      stranger at home, and have no personal motive or interest in the inquiry I
      am about to make.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Barnacle tapped his fingers on the table, and, as if he were now
      sitting for his portrait to a new and strange artist, appeared to say to
      his visitor, ‘If you will be good enough to take me with my present lofty
      expression, I shall feel obliged.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have found a debtor in the Marshalsea Prison of the name of Dorrit, who
      has been there many years. I wish to investigate his confused affairs so
      far as to ascertain whether it may not be possible, after this lapse of
      time, to ameliorate his unhappy condition. The name of Mr Tite Barnacle
      has been mentioned to me as representing some highly influential interest
      among his creditors. Am I correctly informed?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It being one of the principles of the Circumlocution Office never, on any
      account whatever, to give a straightforward answer, Mr Barnacle said,
      ‘Possibly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘On behalf of the Crown, may I ask, or as private individual?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Circumlocution Department, sir,’ Mr Barnacle replied, ‘may have
      possibly recommended—possibly—I cannot say—that some
      public claim against the insolvent estate of a firm or copartnership to
      which this person may have belonged, should be enforced. The question may
      have been, in the course of official business, referred to the
      Circumlocution Department for its consideration. The Department may have
      either originated, or confirmed, a Minute making that recommendation.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I assume this to be the case, then.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Circumlocution Department,’ said Mr Barnacle, ‘is not responsible for
      any gentleman’s assumptions.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I inquire how I can obtain official information as to the real state
      of the case?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is competent,’ said Mr Barnacle, ‘to any member of the—Public,’ 
      mentioning that obscure body with reluctance, as his natural enemy, ‘to
      memorialise the Circumlocution Department. Such formalities as are
      required to be observed in so doing, may be known on application to the
      proper branch of that Department.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which is the proper branch?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I must refer you,’ returned Mr Barnacle, ringing the bell, ‘to the
      Department itself for a formal answer to that inquiry.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Excuse my mentioning—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Department is accessible to the—Public,’ Mr Barnacle was always
      checked a little by that word of impertinent signification, ‘if the—Public
      approaches it according to the official forms; if the—Public does
      not approach it according to the official forms, the—Public has
      itself to blame.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Barnacle made him a severe bow, as a wounded man of family, a wounded
      man of place, and a wounded man of a gentlemanly residence, all rolled
      into one; and he made Mr Barnacle a bow, and was shut out into Mews Street
      by the flabby footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got to this pass, he resolved as an exercise in perseverance, to
      betake himself again to the Circumlocution Office, and try what
      satisfaction he could get there. So he went back to the Circumlocution
      Office, and once more sent up his card to Barnacle junior by a messenger
      who took it very ill indeed that he should come back again, and who was
      eating mashed potatoes and gravy behind a partition by the hall fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was readmitted to the presence of Barnacle junior, and found that young
      gentleman singeing his knees now, and gaping his weary way on to four
      o’clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say. Look here. You stick to us in a devil of a manner,’ Said Barnacle
      junior, looking over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to know—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Look here. Upon my soul you mustn’t come into the place saying you want
      to know, you know,’ remonstrated Barnacle junior, turning about and
      putting up the eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to know,’ said Arthur Clennam, who had made up his mind to
      persistence in one short form of words, ‘the precise nature of the claim
      of the Crown against a prisoner for debt, named Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say. Look here. You really are going it at a great pace, you know.
      Egad, you haven’t got an appointment,’ said Barnacle junior, as if the
      thing were growing serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to know,’ said Arthur, and repeated his case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barnacle junior stared at him until his eye-glass fell out, and then put
      it in again and stared at him until it fell out again. ‘You have no right
      to come this sort of move,’ he then observed with the greatest weakness.
      ‘Look here. What do you mean? You told me you didn’t know whether it was
      public business or not.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have now ascertained that it is public business,’ returned the suitor,
      ‘and I want to know’—and again repeated his monotonous inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its effect upon young Barnacle was to make him repeat in a defenceless
      way, ‘Look here! Upon my SOUL you mustn’t come into the place saying you
      want to know, you know!’ The effect of that upon Arthur Clennam was to
      make him repeat his inquiry in exactly the same words and tone as before.
      The effect of that upon young Barnacle was to make him a wonderful
      spectacle of failure and helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, I tell you what. Look here. You had better try the Secretarial
      Department,’ he said at last, sidling to the bell and ringing it.
      ‘Jenkinson,’ to the mashed potatoes messenger, ‘Mr Wobbler!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam, who now felt that he had devoted himself to the storming
      of the Circumlocution Office, and must go through with it, accompanied the
      messenger to another floor of the building, where that functionary pointed
      out Mr Wobbler’s room. He entered that apartment, and found two gentlemen
      sitting face to face at a large and easy desk, one of whom was polishing a
      gun-barrel on his pocket-handkerchief, while the other was spreading
      marmalade on bread with a paper-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Wobbler?’ inquired the suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen glanced at him, and seemed surprised at his assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So he went,’ said the gentleman with the gun-barrel, who was an extremely
      deliberate speaker, ‘down to his cousin’s place, and took the Dog with him
      by rail. Inestimable Dog. Flew at the porter fellow when he was put into
      the dog-box, and flew at the guard when he was taken out. He got
      half-a-dozen fellows into a Barn, and a good supply of Rats, and timed the
      Dog. Finding the Dog able to do it immensely, made the match, and heavily
      backed the Dog. When the match came off, some devil of a fellow was bought
      over, Sir, Dog was made drunk, Dog’s master was cleaned out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Wobbler?’ inquired the suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman who was spreading the marmalade returned, without looking up
      from that occupation, ‘What did he call the Dog?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Called him Lovely,’ said the other gentleman. ‘Said the Dog was the
      perfect picture of the old aunt from whom he had expectations. Found him
      particularly like her when hocussed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Wobbler?’ said the suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen laughed for some time. The gentleman with the gun-barrel,
      considering it, on inspection, in a satisfactory state, referred it to the
      other; receiving confirmation of his views, he fitted it into its place in
      the case before him, and took out the stock and polished that, softly
      whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Wobbler?’ said the suitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s the matter?’ then said Mr Wobbler, with his mouth full.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to know—’ and Arthur Clennam again mechanically set forth
      what he wanted to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can’t inform you,’ observed Mr Wobbler, apparently to his lunch. ‘Never
      heard of it. Nothing at all to do with it. Better try Mr Clive, second
      door on the left in the next passage.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps he will give me the same answer.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very likely. Don’t know anything about it,’ said Mr Wobbler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suitor turned away and had left the room, when the gentleman with the
      gun called out ‘Mister! Hallo!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Shut the door after you. You’re letting in a devil of a draught here!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps brought him to the second door on the left in the next
      passage. In that room he found three gentlemen; number one doing nothing
      particular, number two doing nothing particular, number three doing
      nothing particular. They seemed, however, to be more directly concerned
      than the others had been in the effective execution of the great principle
      of the office, as there was an awful inner apartment with a double door,
      in which the Circumlocution Sages appeared to be assembled in council, and
      out of which there was an imposing coming of papers, and into which there
      was an imposing going of papers, almost constantly; wherein another
      gentleman, number four, was the active instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to know,’ said Arthur Clennam,—and again stated his case in
      the same barrel-organ way. As number one referred him to number two, and
      as number two referred him to number three, he had occasion to state it
      three times before they all referred him to number four, to whom he stated
      it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number four was a vivacious, well-looking, well-dressed, agreeable young
      fellow—he was a Barnacle, but on the more sprightly side of the
      family—and he said in an easy way, ‘Oh! you had better not bother
      yourself about it, I think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not bother myself about it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No! I recommend you not to bother yourself about it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was such a new point of view that Arthur Clennam found himself at a
      loss how to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can if you like. I can give you plenty of forms to fill up. Lots of
      ‘em here. You can have a dozen if you like. But you’ll never go on with
      it,’ said number four.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Would it be such hopeless work? Excuse me; I am a stranger in England.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>I</i> don’t say it would be hopeless,’ returned number four, with a
      frank smile. ‘I don’t express an opinion about that; I only express an
      opinion about you. <i>I</i> don’t think you’d go on with it. However, of
      course, you can do as you like. I suppose there was a failure in the
      performance of a contract, or something of that kind, was there?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I really don’t know.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well! That you can find out. Then you’ll find out what Department the
      contract was in, and then you’ll find out all about it there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon. How shall I find out?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, you’ll—you’ll ask till they tell you. Then you’ll memorialise
      that Department (according to regular forms which you’ll find out) for
      leave to memorialise this Department. If you get it (which you may after a
      time), that memorial must be entered in that Department, sent to be
      registered in this Department, sent back to be signed by that Department,
      sent back to be countersigned by this Department, and then it will begin
      to be regularly before that Department. You’ll find out when the business
      passes through each of these stages by asking at both Departments till
      they tell you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But surely this is not the way to do the business,’ Arthur Clennam could
      not help saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      This airy young Barnacle was quite entertained by his simplicity in
      supposing for a moment that it was. This light in hand young Barnacle knew
      perfectly that it was not. This touch and go young Barnacle had ‘got up’ 
      the Department in a private secretaryship, that he might be ready for any
      little bit of fat that came to hand; and he fully understood the
      Department to be a politico-diplomatic hocus pocus piece of machinery for
      the assistance of the nobs in keeping off the snobs. This dashing young
      Barnacle, in a word, was likely to become a statesman, and to make a
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When the business is regularly before that Department, whatever it is,’ 
      pursued this bright young Barnacle, ‘then you can watch it from time to
      time through that Department. When it comes regularly before this
      Department, then you must watch it from time to time through this
      Department. We shall have to refer it right and left; and when we refer it
      anywhere, then you’ll have to look it up. When it comes back to us at any
      time, then you had better look <i>us</i> up. When it sticks anywhere,
      you’ll have to try to give it a jog. When you write to another Department
      about it, and then to this Department about it, and don’t hear anything
      satisfactory about it, why then you had better—keep on writing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam looked very doubtful indeed. ‘But I am obliged to you at
      any rate,’ said he, ‘for your politeness.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all,’ replied this engaging young Barnacle. ‘Try the thing, and
      see how you like it. It will be in your power to give it up at any time,
      if you don’t like it. You had better take a lot of forms away with you.
      Give him a lot of forms!’ With which instruction to number two, this
      sparkling young Barnacle took a fresh handful of papers from numbers one
      and three, and carried them into the sanctuary to offer to the presiding
      Idol of the Circumlocution Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam put his forms in his pocket gloomily enough, and went his
      way down the long stone passage and the long stone staircase. He had come
      to the swing doors leading into the street, and was waiting, not over
      patiently, for two people who were between him and them to pass out and
      let him follow, when the voice of one of them struck familiarly on his
      ear. He looked at the speaker and recognised Mr Meagles. Mr Meagles was
      very red in the face—redder than travel could have made him—and
      collaring a short man who was with him, said, ‘come out, you rascal, come
      Out!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such an unexpected hearing, and it was also such an unexpected
      sight to see Mr Meagles burst the swing doors open, and emerge into the
      street with the short man, who was of an unoffending appearance, that
      Clennam stood still for the moment exchanging looks of surprise with the
      porter. He followed, however, quickly; and saw Mr Meagles going down the
      street with his enemy at his side. He soon came up with his old travelling
      companion, and touched him on the back. The choleric face which Mr Meagles
      turned upon him smoothed when he saw who it was, and he put out his
      friendly hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How are you?’ said Mr Meagles. ‘How d’ye <i>do?</i> I have only just come
      over from abroad. I am glad to see you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I am rejoiced to see you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank’ee. Thank’ee!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Meagles and your daughter—?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are as well as possible,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘I only wish you had come upon
      me in a more prepossessing condition as to coolness.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was anything but a hot day, Mr Meagles was in a heated state
      that attracted the attention of the passersby; more particularly as he
      leaned his back against a railing, took off his hat and cravat, and
      heartily rubbed his steaming head and face, and his reddened ears and
      neck, without the least regard for public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Whew!’ said Mr Meagles, dressing again. ‘That’s comfortable. Now I am
      cooler.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have been ruffled, Mr Meagles. What is the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Wait a bit, and I’ll tell you. Have you leisure for a turn in the Park?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As much as you please.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come along then. Ah! you may well look at him.’ He happened to have
      turned his eyes towards the offender whom Mr Meagles had so angrily
      collared. ‘He’s something to look at, that fellow is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not much to look at, either in point of size or in point of dress;
      being merely a short, square, practical looking man, whose hair had turned
      grey, and in whose face and forehead there were deep lines of cogitation,
      which looked as though they were carved in hard wood. He was dressed in
      decent black, a little rusty, and had the appearance of a sagacious master
      in some handicraft. He had a spectacle-case in his hand, which he turned
      over and over while he was thus in question, with a certain free use of
      the thumb that is never seen but in a hand accustomed to tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You keep with us,’ said Mr Meagles, in a threatening kind of Way, ‘and
      I’ll introduce you presently. Now then!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam wondered within himself, as they took the nearest way to the Park,
      what this unknown (who complied in the gentlest manner) could have been
      doing. His appearance did not at all justify the suspicion that he had
      been detected in designs on Mr Meagles’s pocket-handkerchief; nor had he
      any appearance of being quarrelsome or violent. He was a quiet, plain,
      steady man; made no attempt to escape; and seemed a little depressed, but
      neither ashamed nor repentant. If he were a criminal offender, he must
      surely be an incorrigible hypocrite; and if he were no offender, why
      should Mr Meagles have collared him in the Circumlocution Office? He
      perceived that the man was not a difficulty in his own mind alone, but in
      Mr Meagles’s too; for such conversation as they had together on the short
      way to the Park was by no means well sustained, and Mr Meagles’s eye
      always wandered back to the man, even when he spoke of something very
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length they being among the trees, Mr Meagles stopped short, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, will you do me the favour to look at this man? His name is
      Doyce, Daniel Doyce. You wouldn’t suppose this man to be a notorious
      rascal; would you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I certainly should not.’ It was really a disconcerting question, with the
      man there.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. You would not. I know you would not. You wouldn’t suppose him to be a
      public offender; would you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. But he is. He is a public offender. What has he been guilty of?
      Murder, manslaughter, arson, forgery, swindling, house-breaking, highway
      robbery, larceny, conspiracy, fraud? Which should you say, now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I should say,’ returned Arthur Clennam, observing a faint smile in Daniel
      Doyce’s face, ‘not one of them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are right,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘But he has been ingenious, and he has
      been trying to turn his ingenuity to his country’s service. That makes him
      a public offender directly, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at the man himself, who only shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This Doyce,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘is a smith and engineer. He is not in a
      large way, but he is well known as a very ingenious man. A dozen years
      ago, he perfects an invention (involving a very curious secret process) of
      great importance to his country and his fellow-creatures. I won’t say how
      much money it cost him, or how many years of his life he had been about
      it, but he brought it to perfection a dozen years ago. Wasn’t it a dozen?’ 
      said Mr Meagles, addressing Doyce. ‘He is the most exasperating man in the
      world; he never complains!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. Rather better than twelve years ago.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rather better?’ said Mr Meagles, ‘you mean rather worse. Well, Mr
      Clennam, he addresses himself to the Government. The moment he addresses
      himself to the Government, he becomes a public offender! Sir,’ said Mr
      Meagles, in danger of making himself excessively hot again, ‘he ceases to
      be an innocent citizen, and becomes a culprit. He is treated from that
      instant as a man who has done some infernal action. He is a man to be
      shirked, put off, brow-beaten, sneered at, handed over by this
      highly-connected young or old gentleman, to that highly-connected young or
      old gentleman, and dodged back again; he is a man with no rights in his
      own time, or his own property; a mere outlaw, whom it is justifiable to
      get rid of anyhow; a man to be worn out by all possible means.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so difficult to believe, after the morning’s experience, as Mr
      Meagles supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t stand there, Doyce, turning your spectacle-case over and over,’ 
      cried Mr Meagles, ‘but tell Mr Clennam what you confessed to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I undoubtedly was made to feel,’ said the inventor, ‘as if I had
      committed an offence. In dancing attendance at the various offices, I was
      always treated, more or less, as if it was a very bad offence. I have
      frequently found it necessary to reflect, for my own self-support, that I
      really had not done anything to bring myself into the Newgate Calendar,
      but only wanted to effect a great saving and a great improvement.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There!’ said Mr Meagles. ‘Judge whether I exaggerate. Now you’ll be able
      to believe me when I tell you the rest of the case.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this prelude, Mr Meagles went through the narrative; the established
      narrative, which has become tiresome; the matter-of-course narrative which
      we all know by heart. How, after interminable attendance and
      correspondence, after infinite impertinences, ignorances, and insults, my
      lords made a Minute, number three thousand four hundred and seventy-two,
      allowing the culprit to make certain trials of his invention at his own
      expense. How the trials were made in the presence of a board of six, of
      whom two ancient members were too blind to see it, two other ancient
      members were too deaf to hear it, one other ancient member was too lame to
      get near it, and the final ancient member was too pig-headed to look at
      it. How there were more years; more impertinences, ignorances, and
      insults. How my lords then made a Minute, number five thousand one hundred
      and three, whereby they resigned the business to the Circumlocution
      Office. How the Circumlocution Office, in course of time, took up the
      business as if it were a bran new thing of yesterday, which had never been
      heard of before; muddled the business, addled the business, tossed the
      business in a wet blanket. How the impertinences, ignorances, and insults
      went through the multiplication table. How there was a reference of the
      invention to three Barnacles and a Stiltstalking, who knew nothing about
      it; into whose heads nothing could be hammered about it; who got bored
      about it, and reported physical impossibilities about it. How the
      Circumlocution Office, in a Minute, number eight thousand seven hundred
      and forty, ‘saw no reason to reverse the decision at which my lords had
      arrived.’ How the Circumlocution Office, being reminded that my lords had
      arrived at no decision, shelved the business. How there had been a final
      interview with the head of the Circumlocution Office that very morning,
      and how the Brazen Head had spoken, and had been, upon the whole, and
      under all the circumstances, and looking at it from the various points of
      view, of opinion that one of two courses was to be pursued in respect of
      the business: that was to say, either to leave it alone for evermore, or
      to begin it all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Upon which,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘as a practical man, I then and there, in
      that presence, took Doyce by the collar, and told him it was plain to me
      that he was an infamous rascal and treasonable disturber of the government
      peace, and took him away. I brought him out of the office door by the
      collar, that the very porter might know I was a practical man who
      appreciated the official estimate of such characters; and here we are!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      If that airy young Barnacle had been there, he would have frankly told
      them perhaps that the Circumlocution Office had achieved its function.
      That what the Barnacles had to do, was to stick on to the national ship as
      long as they could. That to trim the ship, lighten the ship, clean the
      ship, would be to knock them off; that they could but be knocked off once;
      and that if the ship went down with them yet sticking to it, that was the
      ship’s look out, and not theirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There!’ said Mr Meagles, ‘now you know all about Doyce. Except, which I
      own does not improve my state of mind, that even now you don’t hear him
      complain.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must have great patience,’ said Arthur Clennam, looking at him with
      some wonder, ‘great forbearance.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ he returned, ‘I don’t know that I have more than another man.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By the Lord, you have more than I have, though!’ cried Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doyce smiled, as he said to Clennam, ‘You see, my experience of these
      things does not begin with myself. It has been in my way to know a little
      about them from time to time. Mine is not a particular case. I am not
      worse used than a hundred others who have put themselves in the same
      position—than all the others, I was going to say.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know that I should find that a consolation, if it were my case;
      but I am very glad that you do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Understand me! I don’t say,’ he replied in his steady, planning way, and
      looking into the distance before him as if his grey eye were measuring it,
      ‘that it’s recompense for a man’s toil and hope; but it’s a certain sort
      of relief to know that I might have counted on this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in that quiet deliberate manner, and in that undertone, which is
      often observable in mechanics who consider and adjust with great nicety.
      It belonged to him like his suppleness of thumb, or his peculiar way of
      tilting up his hat at the back every now and then, as if he were
      contemplating some half-finished work of his hand and thinking about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Disappointed?’ he went on, as he walked between them under the trees.
      ‘Yes. No doubt I am disappointed. Hurt? Yes. No doubt I am hurt. That’s
      only natural. But what I mean when I say that people who put themselves in
      the same position are mostly used in the same way—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In England,’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! of course I mean in England. When they take their inventions into
      foreign countries, that’s quite different. And that’s the reason why so
      many go there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles very hot indeed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What I mean is, that however this comes to be the regular way of our
      government, it is its regular way. Have you ever heard of any projector or
      inventor who failed to find it all but inaccessible, and whom it did not
      discourage and ill-treat?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I cannot say that I ever have.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you ever known it to be beforehand in the adoption of any useful
      thing? Ever known it to set an example of any useful kind?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am a good deal older than my friend here,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘and I’ll
      answer that. Never.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But we all three have known, I expect,’ said the inventor, ‘a pretty many
      cases of its fixed determination to be miles upon miles, and years upon
      years, behind the rest of us; and of its being found out persisting in the
      use of things long superseded, even after the better things were well
      known and generally taken up?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They all agreed upon that.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well then,’ said Doyce, with a sigh, ‘as I know what such a metal will do
      at such a temperature, and such a body under such a pressure, so I may
      know (if I will only consider), how these great lords and gentlemen will
      certainly deal with such a matter as mine. I have no right to be
      surprised, with a head upon my shoulders, and memory in it, that I fall
      into the ranks with all who came before me. I ought to have let it alone.
      I have had warning enough, I am sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he put up his spectacle-case, and said to Arthur, ‘If I don’t
      complain, Mr Clennam, I can feel gratitude; and I assure you that I feel
      it towards our mutual friend. Many’s the day, and many’s the way in which
      he has backed me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stuff and nonsense,’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur could not but glance at Daniel Doyce in the ensuing silence. Though
      it was evidently in the grain of his character, and of his respect for his
      own case, that he should abstain from idle murmuring, it was evident that
      he had grown the older, the sterner, and the poorer, for his long
      endeavour. He could not but think what a blessed thing it would have been
      for this man, if he had taken a lesson from the gentlemen who were so kind
      as to take a nation’s affairs in charge, and had learnt How not to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles was hot and despondent for about five minutes, and then began
      to cool and clear up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come, come!’ said he. ‘We shall not make this the better by being grim.
      Where do you think of going, Dan?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall go back to the factory,’ said Dan.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why then, we’ll all go back to the factory, or walk in that direction,’ 
      returned Mr Meagles cheerfully. ‘Mr Clennam won’t be deterred by its being
      in Bleeding Heart Yard.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bleeding Heart Yard?’ said Clennam. ‘I want to go there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So much the better,’ cried Mr Meagles. ‘Come along!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went along, certainly one of the party, and probably more than
      one, thought that Bleeding Heart Yard was no inappropriate destination for
      a man who had been in official correspondence with my lords and the
      Barnacles—and perhaps had a misgiving also that Britannia herself
      might come to look for lodgings in Bleeding Heart Yard some ugly day or
      other, if she over-did the Circumlocution Office.

	</hgroup>
<p>A late, dull autumn night was closing in upon the river Saone. The stream,
      like a sullied looking-glass in a gloomy place, reflected the clouds
      heavily; and the low banks leaned over here and there, as if they were
      half curious, and half afraid, to see their darkening pictures in the
      water. The flat expanse of country about Chalons lay a long heavy streak,
      occasionally made a little ragged by a row of poplar trees against the
      wrathful sunset. On the banks of the river Saone it was wet, depressing,
      solitary; and the night deepened fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      One man slowly moving on towards Chalons was the only visible figure in
      the landscape. Cain might have looked as lonely and avoided. With an old
      sheepskin knapsack at his back, and a rough, unbarked stick cut out of
      some wood in his hand; miry, footsore, his shoes and gaiters trodden out,
      his hair and beard untrimmed; the cloak he carried over his shoulder, and
      the clothes he wore, sodden with wet; limping along in pain and
      difficulty; he looked as if the clouds were hurrying from him, as if the
      wail of the wind and the shuddering of the grass were directed against
      him, as if the low mysterious plashing of the water murmured at him, as if
      the fitful autumn night were disturbed by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced here, and he glanced there, sullenly but shrinkingly; and
      sometimes stopped and turned about, and looked all round him. Then he
      limped on again, toiling and muttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To the devil with this plain that has no end! To the devil with these
      stones that cut like knives! To the devil with this dismal darkness,
      wrapping itself about one with a chill! I hate you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      And he would have visited his hatred upon it all with the scowl he threw
      about him, if he could. He trudged a little further; and looking into the
      distance before him, stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I, hungry, thirsty, weary. You, imbeciles, where the lights are yonder,
      eating and drinking, and warming yourselves at fires! I wish I had the
      sacking of your town; I would repay you, my children!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the teeth he set at the town, and the hand he shook at the town,
      brought the town no nearer; and the man was yet hungrier, and thirstier,
      and wearier, when his feet were on its jagged pavement, and he stood
      looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the hotel with its gateway, and its savoury smell of cooking;
      there was the cafe with its bright windows, and its rattling of dominoes;
      there was the dyer’s with its strips of red cloth on the doorposts; there
      was the silversmith’s with its earrings, and its offerings for altars;
      there was the tobacco dealer’s with its lively group of soldier customers
      coming out pipe in mouth; there were the bad odours of the town, and the
      rain and the refuse in the kennels, and the faint lamps slung across the
      road, and the huge Diligence, and its mountain of luggage, and its six
      grey horses with their tails tied up, getting under weigh at the coach
      office. But no small cabaret for a straitened traveller being within
      sight, he had to seek one round the dark corner, where the cabbage leaves
      lay thickest, trodden about the public cistern at which women had not yet
      left off drawing water. There, in the back street he found one, the Break
      of Day. The curtained windows clouded the Break of Day, but it seemed
      light and warm, and it announced in legible inscriptions with appropriate
      pictorial embellishment of billiard cue and ball, that at the Break of Day
      one could play billiards; that there one could find meat, drink, and
      lodgings, whether one came on horseback, or came on foot; and that it kept
      good wines, liqueurs, and brandy. The man turned the handle of the Break
      of Day door, and limped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He touched his discoloured slouched hat, as he came in at the door, to a
      few men who occupied the room. Two were playing dominoes at one of the
      little tables; three or four were seated round the stove, conversing as
      they smoked; the billiard-table in the centre was left alone for the time;
      the landlady of the Daybreak sat behind her little counter among her
      cloudy bottles of syrups, baskets of cakes, and leaden drainage for
      glasses, working at her needle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making his way to an empty little table in a corner of the room behind the
      stove, he put down his knapsack and his cloak upon the ground. As he
      raised his head from stooping to do so, he found the landlady beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One can lodge here to-night, madame?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perfectly!’ said the landlady in a high, sing-song, cheery voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good. One can dine—sup—what you please to call it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, perfectly!’ cried the landlady as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dispatch then, madame, if you please. Something to eat, as quickly as you
      can; and some wine at once. I am exhausted.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is very bad weather, monsieur,’ said the landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cursed weather.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And a very long road.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A cursed road.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His hoarse voice failed him, and he rested his head upon his hands until a
      bottle of wine was brought from the counter. Having filled and emptied his
      little tumbler twice, and having broken off an end from the great loaf
      that was set before him with his cloth and napkin, soup-plate, salt,
      pepper, and oil, he rested his back against the corner of the wall, made a
      couch of the bench on which he sat, and began to chew crust, until such
      time as his repast should be ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been that momentary interruption of the talk about the stove,
      and that temporary inattention to and distraction from one another, which
      is usually inseparable in such a company from the arrival of a stranger.
      It had passed over by this time; and the men had done glancing at him, and
      were talking again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s the true reason,’ said one of them, bringing a story he had been
      telling, to a close, ‘that’s the true reason why they said that the devil
      was let loose.’ The speaker was the tall Swiss belonging to the church,
      and he brought something of the authority of the church into the
      discussion—especially as the devil was in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady having given her directions for the new guest’s entertainment
      to her husband, who acted as cook to the Break of Day, had resumed her
      needlework behind her counter. She was a smart, neat, bright little woman,
      with a good deal of cap and a good deal of stocking, and she struck into
      the conversation with several laughing nods of her head, but without
      looking up from her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah Heaven, then,’ said she. ‘When the boat came up from Lyons, and
      brought the news that the devil was actually let loose at Marseilles, some
      fly-catchers swallowed it. But I? No, not I.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Madame, you are always right,’ returned the tall Swiss. ‘Doubtless you
      were enraged against that man, madame?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay, yes, then!’ cried the landlady, raising her eyes from her work,
      opening them very wide, and tossing her head on one side. ‘Naturally,
      yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He was a bad subject.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He was a wicked wretch,’ said the landlady, ‘and well merited what he had
      the good fortune to escape. So much the worse.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay, madame! Let us see,’ returned the Swiss, argumentatively turning
      his cigar between his lips. ‘It may have been his unfortunate destiny. He
      may have been the child of circumstances. It is always possible that he
      had, and has, good in him if one did but know how to find it out.
      Philosophical philanthropy teaches—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the little knot about the stove murmured an objection to the
      introduction of that threatening expression. Even the two players at
      dominoes glanced up from their game, as if to protest against
      philosophical philanthropy being brought by name into the Break of Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hold there, you and your philanthropy,’ cried the smiling landlady,
      nodding her head more than ever. ‘Listen then. I am a woman, I. I know
      nothing of philosophical philanthropy. But I know what I have seen, and
      what I have looked in the face in this world here, where I find myself.
      And I tell you this, my friend, that there are people (men and women both,
      unfortunately) who have no good in them—none. That there are people
      whom it is necessary to detest without compromise. That there are people
      who must be dealt with as enemies of the human race. That there are people
      who have no human heart, and who must be crushed like savage beasts and
      cleared out of the way. They are but few, I hope; but I have seen (in this
      world here where I find myself, and even at the little Break of Day) that
      there are such people. And I do not doubt that this man—whatever
      they call him, I forget his name—is one of them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady’s lively speech was received with greater favour at the Break
      of Day, than it would have elicited from certain amiable whitewashers of
      the class she so unreasonably objected to, nearer Great Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My faith! If your philosophical philanthropy,’ said the landlady, putting
      down her work, and rising to take the stranger’s soup from her husband,
      who appeared with it at a side door, ‘puts anybody at the mercy of such
      people by holding terms with them at all, in words or deeds, or both, take
      it away from the Break of Day, for it isn’t worth a sou.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she placed the soup before the guest, who changed his attitude to a
      sitting one, he looked her full in the face, and his moustache went up
      under his nose, and his nose came down over his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ said the previous speaker, ‘let us come back to our subject.
      Leaving all that aside, gentlemen, it was because the man was acquitted on
      his trial that people said at Marseilles that the devil was let loose.
      That was how the phrase began to circulate, and what it meant; nothing
      more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do they call him?’ said the landlady. ‘Biraud, is it not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rigaud, madame,’ returned the tall Swiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rigaud! To be sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller’s soup was succeeded by a dish of meat, and that by a dish
      of vegetables. He ate all that was placed before him, emptied his bottle
      of wine, called for a glass of rum, and smoked his cigarette with his cup
      of coffee. As he became refreshed, he became overbearing; and patronised
      the company at the Daybreak in certain small talk at which he assisted, as
      if his condition were far above his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company might have had other engagements, or they might have felt
      their inferiority, but in any case they dispersed by degrees, and not
      being replaced by other company, left their new patron in possession of
      the Break of Day. The landlord was clinking about in his kitchen; the
      landlady was quiet at her work; and the refreshed traveller sat smoking by
      the stove, warming his ragged feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pardon me, madame—that Biraud.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rigaud, monsieur.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Rigaud. Pardon me again—has contracted your displeasure, how?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady, who had been at one moment thinking within herself that this
      was a handsome man, at another moment that this was an ill-looking man,
      observed the nose coming down and the moustache going up, and strongly
      inclined to the latter decision. Rigaud was a criminal, she said, who had
      killed his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay, ay? Death of my life, that’s a criminal indeed. But how do you know
      it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All the world knows it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hah! And yet he escaped justice?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Monsieur, the law could not prove it against him to its satisfaction. So
      the law says. Nevertheless, all the world knows he did it. The people knew
      it so well, that they tried to tear him to pieces.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Being all in perfect accord with their own wives?’ said the guest.
      ‘Haha!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady of the Break of Day looked at him again, and felt almost
      confirmed in her last decision. He had a fine hand, though, and he turned
      it with a great show. She began once more to think that he was not
      ill-looking after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did you mention, madame—or was it mentioned among the gentlemen—what
      became of him?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady shook her head; it being the first conversational stage at
      which her vivacious earnestness had ceased to nod it, keeping time to what
      she said. It had been mentioned at the Daybreak, she remarked, on the
      authority of the journals, that he had been kept in prison for his own
      safety. However that might be, he had escaped his deserts; so much the
      worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guest sat looking at her as he smoked out his final cigarette, and as
      she sat with her head bent over her work, with an expression that might
      have resolved her doubts, and brought her to a lasting conclusion on the
      subject of his good or bad looks if she had seen it. When she did look up,
      the expression was not there. The hand was smoothing his shaggy moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May one ask to be shown to bed, madame?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very willingly, monsieur. Hola, my husband! My husband would conduct him
      up-stairs. There was one traveller there, asleep, who had gone to bed very
      early indeed, being overpowered by fatigue; but it was a large chamber
      with two beds in it, and space enough for twenty. This the landlady of the
      Break of Day chirpingly explained, calling between whiles, ‘Hola, my
      husband!’ out at the side door.
    </p>
    <p>
      My husband answered at length, ‘It is I, my wife!’ and presenting himself
      in his cook’s cap, lighted the traveller up a steep and narrow staircase;
      the traveller carrying his own cloak and knapsack, and bidding the
      landlady good night with a complimentary reference to the pleasure of
      seeing her again to-morrow. It was a large room, with a rough splintery
      floor, unplastered rafters overhead, and two bedsteads on opposite sides.
      Here ‘my husband’ put down the candle he carried, and with a sidelong look
      at his guest stooping over his knapsack, gruffly gave him the instruction,
      ‘The bed to the right!’ and left him to his repose. The landlord, whether
      he was a good or a bad physiognomist, had fully made up his mind that the
      guest was an ill-looking fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guest looked contemptuously at the clean coarse bedding prepared for
      him, and, sitting down on the rush chair at the bedside, drew his money
      out of his pocket, and told it over in his hand. ‘One must eat,’ he
      muttered to himself, ‘but by Heaven I must eat at the cost of some other
      man to-morrow!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sat pondering, and mechanically weighing his money in his palm, the
      deep breathing of the traveller in the other bed fell so regularly upon
      his hearing that it attracted his eyes in that direction. The man was
      covered up warm, and had drawn the white curtain at his head, so that he
      could be only heard, not seen. But the deep regular breathing, still going
      on while the other was taking off his worn shoes and gaiters, and still
      continuing when he had laid aside his coat and cravat, became at length a
      strong provocative to curiosity, and incentive to get a glimpse of the
      sleeper’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The waking traveller, therefore, stole a little nearer, and yet a little
      nearer, and a little nearer to the sleeping traveller’s bed, until he
      stood close beside it. Even then he could not see his face, for he had
      drawn the sheet over it. The regular breathing still continuing, he put
      his smooth white hand (such a treacherous hand it looked, as it went
      creeping from him!) to the sheet, and gently lifted it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Death of my soul!’ he whispered, falling back, ‘here’s Cavalletto!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little Italian, previously influenced in his sleep, perhaps, by the
      stealthy presence at his bedside, stopped in his regular breathing, and
      with a long deep respiration opened his eyes. At first they were not
      awake, though open. He lay for some seconds looking placidly at his old
      prison companion, and then, all at once, with a cry of surprise and alarm,
      sprang out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush! What’s the matter? Keep quiet! It’s I. You know me?’ cried the
      other, in a suppressed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      But John Baptist, widely staring, muttering a number of invocations and
      ejaculations, tremblingly backing into a corner, slipping on his trousers,
      and tying his coat by the two sleeves round his neck, manifested an
      unmistakable desire to escape by the door rather than renew the
      acquaintance. Seeing this, his old prison comrade fell back upon the door,
      and set his shoulders against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cavalletto! Wake, boy! Rub your eyes and look at me. Not the name you
      used to call me—don’t use that—Lagnier, say Lagnier!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist, staring at him with eyes opened to their utmost width, made
      a number of those national, backhanded shakes of the right forefinger in
      the air, as if he were resolved on negativing beforehand everything that
      the other could possibly advance during the whole term of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cavalletto! Give me your hand. You know Lagnier, the gentleman. Touch the
      hand of a gentleman!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Submitting himself to the old tone of condescending authority, John
      Baptist, not at all steady on his legs as yet, advanced and put his hand
      in his patron’s. Monsieur Lagnier laughed; and having given it a squeeze,
      tossed it up and let it go.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you were—’ faltered John Baptist.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not shaved? No. See here!’ cried Lagnier, giving his head a twirl; ‘as
      tight on as your own.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist, with a slight shiver, looked all round the room as if to
      recall where he was. His patron took that opportunity of turning the key
      in the door, and then sat down upon his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Look!’ he said, holding up his shoes and gaiters. ‘That’s a poor trim for
      a gentleman, you’ll say. No matter, you shall see how soon I’ll mend it.
      Come and sit down. Take your old place!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist, looking anything but reassured, sat down on the floor at the
      bedside, keeping his eyes upon his patron all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s well!’ cried Lagnier. ‘Now we might be in the old infernal hole
      again, hey? How long have you been out?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Two days after you, my master.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do you come here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was cautioned not to stay there, and so I left the town at once, and
      since then I have changed about. I have been doing odds and ends at
      Avignon, at Pont Esprit, at Lyons; upon the Rhone, upon the Saone.’ As he
      spoke, he rapidly mapped the places out with his sunburnt hand upon the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And where are you going?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Going, my master?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist seemed to desire to evade the question without knowing how.
      ‘By Bacchus!’ he said at last, as if he were forced to the admission, ‘I
      have sometimes had a thought of going to Paris, and perhaps to England.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cavalletto. This is in confidence. I also am going to Paris and perhaps
      to England. We’ll go together.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man nodded his head, and showed his teeth; and yet seemed not
      quite convinced that it was a surpassingly desirable arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We’ll go together,’ repeated Lagnier. ‘You shall see how soon I will
      force myself to be recognised as a gentleman, and you shall profit by it.
      It is agreed? Are we one?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, surely, surely!’ said the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you shall hear before I sleep—and in six words, for I want
      sleep—how I appear before you, I, Lagnier. Remember that. Not the
      other.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Altro, altro! Not Ri——’ Before John Baptist could finish the
      name, his comrade had got his hand under his chin and fiercely shut up his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Death! what are you doing? Do you want me to be trampled upon and stoned?
      Do <i>you</i> want to be trampled upon and stoned? You would be. You don’t
      imagine that they would set upon me, and let my prison chum go? Don’t
      think it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an expression in his face as he released his grip of his
      friend’s jaw, from which his friend inferred that if the course of events
      really came to any stoning and trampling, Monsieur Lagnier would so
      distinguish him with his notice as to ensure his having his full share of
      it. He remembered what a cosmopolitan gentleman Monsieur Lagnier was, and
      how few weak distinctions he made.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am a man,’ said Monsieur Lagnier, ‘whom society has deeply wronged
      since you last saw me. You know that I am sensitive and brave, and that it
      is my character to govern. How has society respected those qualities in
      me? I have been shrieked at through the streets. I have been guarded
      through the streets against men, and especially women, running at me armed
      with any weapons they could lay their hands on. I have lain in prison for
      security, with the place of my confinement kept a secret, lest I should be
      torn out of it and felled by a hundred blows. I have been carted out of
      Marseilles in the dead of night, and carried leagues away from it packed
      in straw. It has not been safe for me to go near my house; and, with a
      beggar’s pittance in my pocket, I have walked through vile mud and weather
      ever since, until my feet are crippled—look at them! Such are the
      humiliations that society has inflicted upon me, possessing the qualities
      I have mentioned, and which you know me to possess. But society shall pay
      for it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this he said in his companion’s ear, and with his hand before his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Even here,’ he went on in the same way, ‘even in this mean drinking-shop,
      society pursues me. Madame defames me, and her guests defame me. I, too, a
      gentleman with manners and accomplishments to strike them dead! But the
      wrongs society has heaped upon me are treasured in this breast.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To all of which John Baptist, listening attentively to the suppressed
      hoarse voice, said from time to time, ‘Surely, surely!’ tossing his head
      and shutting his eyes, as if there were the clearest case against society
      that perfect candour could make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Put my shoes there,’ continued Lagnier. ‘Hang my cloak to dry there by
      the door. Take my hat.’ He obeyed each instruction, as it was given. ‘And
      this is the bed to which society consigns me, is it? Hah. <i>Very</i>
      well!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stretched out his length upon it, with a ragged handkerchief bound
      round his wicked head, and only his wicked head showing above the
      bedclothes, John Baptist was rather strongly reminded of what had so very
      nearly happened to prevent the moustache from any more going up as it did,
      and the nose from any more coming down as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Shaken out of destiny’s dice-box again into your company, eh? By Heaven!
      So much the better for you. You’ll profit by it. I shall need a long rest.
      Let me sleep in the morning.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      John Baptist replied that he should sleep as long as he would, and wishing
      him a happy night, put out the candle. One might have supposed that the
      next proceeding of the Italian would have been to undress; but he did
      exactly the reverse, and dressed himself from head to foot, saving his
      shoes. When he had so done, he lay down upon his bed with some of its
      coverings over him, and his coat still tied round his neck, to get through
      the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he started up, the Godfather Break of Day was peeping at its
      namesake. He rose, took his shoes in his hand, turned the key in the door
      with great caution, and crept downstairs. Nothing was astir there but the
      smell of coffee, wine, tobacco, and syrups; and madame’s little counter
      looked ghastly enough. But he had paid madame his little note at it over
      night, and wanted to see nobody—wanted nothing but to get on his
      shoes and his knapsack, open the door, and run away.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0131m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0131m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0131.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      He prospered in his object. No movement or voice was heard when he opened
      the door; no wicked head tied up in a ragged handkerchief looked out of
      the upper window. When the sun had raised his full disc above the flat
      line of the horizon, and was striking fire out of the long muddy vista of
      paved road with its weary avenue of little trees, a black speck moved
      along the road and splashed among the flaming pools of rain-water, which
      black speck was John Baptist Cavalletto running away from his patron.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Bleeding Heart Yard</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>In London itself, though in the old rustic road towards a suburb of note
      where in the days of William Shakespeare, author and stage-player, there
      were Royal hunting-seats—howbeit no sport is left there now but for
      hunters of men—Bleeding Heart Yard was to be found; a place much
      changed in feature and in fortune, yet with some relish of ancient
      greatness about it. Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys, and a few
      large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the
      recognition of their old proportions, gave the Yard a character. It was
      inhabited by poor people, who set up their rest among its faded glories,
      as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen stones of the
      Pyramids; but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent in the
      Yard, that it had a character.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if the aspiring city had become puffed up in the very ground on which
      it stood, the ground had so risen about Bleeding Heart Yard that you got
      into it down a flight of steps which formed no part of the original
      approach, and got out of it by a low gateway into a maze of shabby
      streets, which went about and about, tortuously ascending to the level
      again. At this end of the Yard and over the gateway, was the factory of
      Daniel Doyce, often heavily beating like a bleeding heart of iron, with
      the clink of metal upon metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opinion of the Yard was divided respecting the derivation of its name.
      The more practical of its inmates abided by the tradition of a murder; the
      gentler and more imaginative inhabitants, including the whole of the
      tender sex, were loyal to the legend of a young lady of former times
      closely imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for remaining true to
      her own true love, and refusing to marry the suitor he chose for her. The
      legend related how that the young lady used to be seen up at her window
      behind the bars, murmuring a love-lorn song of which the burden was,
      ‘Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away,’ until she died. It was
      objected by the murderous party that this Refrain was notoriously the
      invention of a tambour-worker, a spinster and romantic, still lodging in
      the Yard. But, forasmuch as all favourite legends must be associated with
      the affections, and as many more people fall in love than commit murder—which
      it may be hoped, howsoever bad we are, will continue until the end of the
      world to be the dispensation under which we shall live—the Bleeding
      Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away story, carried the day by a great
      majority. Neither party would listen to the antiquaries who delivered
      learned lectures in the neighbourhood, showing the Bleeding Heart to have
      been the heraldic cognisance of the old family to whom the property had
      once belonged. And, considering that the hour-glass they turned from year
      to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand, the Bleeding
      Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one
      little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down in to the Yard, by way of the steps, came Daniel Doyce, Mr Meagles,
      and Clennam. Passing along the Yard, and between the open doors on either
      hand, all abundantly garnished with light children nursing heavy ones,
      they arrived at its opposite boundary, the gateway. Here Arthur Clennam
      stopped to look about him for the domicile of Plornish, plasterer, whose
      name, according to the custom of Londoners, Daniel Doyce had never seen or
      heard of to that hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was plain enough, nevertheless, as Little Dorrit had said; over a
      lime-splashed gateway in the corner, within which Plornish kept a ladder
      and a barrel or two. The last house in Bleeding Heart Yard which she had
      described as his place of habitation, was a large house, let off to
      various tenants; but Plornish ingeniously hinted that he lived in the
      parlour, by means of a painted hand under his name, the forefinger of
      which hand (on which the artist had depicted a ring and a most elaborate
      nail of the genteelest form) referred all inquirers to that apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parting from his companions, after arranging another meeting with Mr
      Meagles, Clennam went alone into the entry, and knocked with his knuckles
      at the parlour-door. It was opened presently by a woman with a child in
      her arms, whose unoccupied hand was hastily rearranging the upper part of
      her dress. This was Mrs Plornish, and this maternal action was the action
      of Mrs Plornish during a large part of her waking existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Mr Plornish at home? ‘Well, sir,’ said Mrs Plornish, a civil woman,
      ‘not to deceive you, he’s gone to look for a job.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not to deceive you’ was a method of speech with Mrs Plornish. She would
      deceive you, under any circumstances, as little as might be; but she had a
      trick of answering in this provisional form.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you think he will be back soon, if I wait for him?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have been expecting him,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘this half an hour, at any
      minute of time. Walk in, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur entered the rather dark and close parlour (though it was lofty
      too), and sat down in the chair she placed for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not to deceive you, sir, I notice it,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘and I take it
      kind of you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was at a loss to understand what she meant; and by expressing as much
      in his looks, elicited her explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It ain’t many that comes into a poor place, that deems it worth their
      while to move their hats,’ said Mrs Plornish. ‘But people think more of it
      than people think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam returned, with an uncomfortable feeling in so very slight a
      courtesy being unusual, Was that all! And stooping down to pinch the cheek
      of another young child who was sitting on the floor, staring at him, asked
      Mrs Plornish how old that fine boy was?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Four year just turned, sir,’ said Mrs Plornish. ‘He <i>is</i> a fine
      little fellow, ain’t he, sir? But this one is rather sickly.’ She tenderly
      hushed the baby in her arms, as she said it. ‘You wouldn’t mind my asking
      if it happened to be a job as you was come about, sir, would you?’ asked
      Mrs Plornish wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked it so anxiously, that if he had been in possession of any kind
      of tenement, he would have had it plastered a foot deep rather than answer
      No. But he was obliged to answer No; and he saw a shade of disappointment
      on her face, as she checked a sigh, and looked at the low fire. Then he
      saw, also, that Mrs Plornish was a young woman, made somewhat slatternly
      in herself and her belongings by poverty; and so dragged at by poverty and
      the children together, that their united forces had already dragged her
      face into wrinkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All such things as jobs,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘seems to me to have gone
      underground, they do indeed.’ (Herein Mrs Plornish limited her remark to
      the plastering trade, and spoke without reference to the Circumlocution
      Office and the Barnacle Family.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it so difficult to get work?’ asked Arthur Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Plornish finds it so,’ she returned. ‘He is quite unfortunate. Really he
      is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Really he was. He was one of those many wayfarers on the road of life, who
      seem to be afflicted with supernatural corns, rendering it impossible for
      them to keep up even with their lame competitors. A willing, working, soft
      hearted, not hard-headed fellow, Plornish took his fortune as smoothly as
      could be expected; but it was a rough one. It so rarely happened that
      anybody seemed to want him, it was such an exceptional case when his
      powers were in any request, that his misty mind could not make out how it
      happened. He took it as it came, therefore; he tumbled into all kinds of
      difficulties, and tumbled out of them; and, by tumbling through life, got
      himself considerably bruised.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s not for want of looking after jobs, I am sure,’ said Mrs Plornish,
      lifting up her eyebrows, and searching for a solution of the problem
      between the bars of the grate; ‘nor yet for want of working at them when
      they are to be got. No one ever heard my husband complain of work.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow or other, this was the general misfortune of Bleeding Heart Yard.
      From time to time there were public complaints, pathetically going about,
      of labour being scarce—which certain people seemed to take
      extraordinarily ill, as though they had an absolute right to it on their
      own terms—but Bleeding Heart Yard, though as willing a Yard as any
      in Britain, was never the better for the demand. That high old family, the
      Barnacles, had long been too busy with their great principle to look into
      the matter; and indeed the matter had nothing to do with their
      watchfulness in out-generalling all other high old families except the
      Stiltstalkings.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Mrs Plornish spoke in these words of her absent lord, her lord
      returned. A smooth-cheeked, fresh-coloured, sandy-whiskered man of thirty.
      Long in the legs, yielding at the knees, foolish in the face,
      flannel-jacketed, lime-whitened.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is Plornish, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I came,’ said Clennam, rising, ‘to beg the favour of a little
      conversation with you on the subject of the Dorrit family.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Plornish became suspicious. Seemed to scent a creditor. Said, ‘Ah, yes.
      Well. He didn’t know what satisfaction <i>he</i> could give any gentleman,
      respecting that family. What might it be about, now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know you better,’ said Clennam, smiling, ‘than you suppose.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Plornish observed, not smiling in return, And yet he hadn’t the pleasure
      of being acquainted with the gentleman, neither.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Arthur, ‘I know your kind offices at second hand, but on the
      best authority; through Little Dorrit.—I mean,’ he explained, ‘Miss
      Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, is it? Oh! I’ve heard of you, Sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I of you,’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Please to sit down again, Sir, and consider yourself welcome.—Why,
      yes,’ said Plornish, taking a chair, and lifting the elder child upon his
      knee, that he might have the moral support of speaking to a stranger over
      his head, ‘I have been on the wrong side of the Lock myself, and in that
      way we come to know Miss Dorrit. Me and my wife, we are well acquainted
      with Miss Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Intimate!’ cried Mrs Plornish. Indeed, she was so proud of the
      acquaintance, that she had awakened some bitterness of spirit in the Yard
      by magnifying to an enormous amount the sum for which Miss Dorrit’s father
      had become insolvent. The Bleeding Hearts resented her claiming to know
      people of such distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was her father that I got acquainted with first. And through getting
      acquainted with him, you see—why—I got acquainted with her,’ 
      said Plornish tautologically.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! And there’s manners! There’s polish! There’s a gentleman to have run
      to seed in the Marshalsea jail! Why, perhaps you are not aware,’ said
      Plornish, lowering his voice, and speaking with a perverse admiration of
      what he ought to have pitied or despised, ‘not aware that Miss Dorrit and
      her sister dursn’t let him know that they work for a living. No!’ said
      Plornish, looking with a ridiculous triumph first at his wife, and then
      all round the room. ‘Dursn’t let him know it, they dursn’t!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Without admiring him for that,’ Clennam quietly observed, ‘I am very
      sorry for him.’ The remark appeared to suggest to Plornish, for the first
      time, that it might not be a very fine trait of character after all. He
      pondered about it for a moment, and gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to me,’ he resumed, ‘certainly Mr Dorrit is as affable with me, I am
      sure, as I can possibly expect. Considering the differences and distances
      betwixt us, more so. But it’s Miss Dorrit that we were speaking of.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True. Pray how did you introduce her at my mother’s!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Plornish picked a bit of lime out of his whisker, put it between his
      lips, turned it with his tongue like a sugar-plum, considered, found
      himself unequal to the task of lucid explanation, and appealing to his
      wife, said, ‘Sally, <i>you</i> may as well mention how it was, old woman.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Dorrit,’ said Sally, hushing the baby from side to side, and laying
      her chin upon the little hand as it tried to disarrange the gown again,
      ‘came here one afternoon with a bit of writing, telling that how she
      wished for needlework, and asked if it would be considered any
      ill-conwenience in case she was to give her address here.’ (Plornish
      repeated, her address here, in a low voice, as if he were making responses
      at church.) ‘Me and Plornish says, No, Miss Dorrit, no ill-conwenience,’ 
      (Plornish repeated, no ill-conwenience,) ‘and she wrote it in, according.
      Which then me and Plornish says, Ho Miss Dorrit!’ (Plornish repeated, Ho
      Miss Dorrit.) ‘Have you thought of copying it three or four times, as the
      way to make it known in more places than one? No, says Miss Dorrit, I have
      not, but I will. She copied it out according, on this table, in a sweet
      writing, and Plornish, he took it where he worked, having a job just
      then,’ (Plornish repeated job just then,) ‘and likewise to the landlord of
      the Yard; through which it was that Mrs Clennam first happened to employ
      Miss Dorrit.’ Plornish repeated, employ Miss Dorrit; and Mrs Plornish
      having come to an end, feigned to bite the fingers of the little hand as
      she kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The landlord of the Yard,’ said Arthur Clennam, ‘is—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He is Mr Casby, by name, he is,’ said Plornish, ‘and Pancks, he collects
      the rents. That,’ added Mr Plornish, dwelling on the subject with a slow
      thoughtfulness that appeared to have no connection with any specific
      object, and to lead him nowhere, ‘that is about what <i>they</i> are, you
      may believe me or not, as you think proper.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay?’ returned Clennam, thoughtful in his turn. ‘Mr Casby, too! An old
      acquaintance of mine, long ago!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Plornish did not see his road to any comment on this fact, and made
      none. As there truly was no reason why he should have the least interest
      in it, Arthur Clennam went on to the present purport of his visit; namely,
      to make Plornish the instrument of effecting Tip’s release, with as little
      detriment as possible to the self-reliance and self-helpfulness of the
      young man, supposing him to possess any remnant of those qualities:
      without doubt a very wide stretch of supposition. Plornish, having been
      made acquainted with the cause of action from the Defendant’s own mouth,
      gave Arthur to understand that the Plaintiff was a ‘Chaunter’—meaning,
      not a singer of anthems, but a seller of horses—and that he
      (Plornish) considered that ten shillings in the pound ‘would settle
      handsome,’ and that more would be a waste of money. The Principal and
      instrument soon drove off together to a stable-yard in High Holborn, where
      a remarkably fine grey gelding, worth, at the lowest figure, seventy-five
      guineas (not taking into account the value of the shot he had been made to
      swallow for the improvement of his form), was to be parted with for a
      twenty-pound note, in consequence of his having run away last week with
      Mrs Captain Barbary of Cheltenham, who wasn’t up to a horse of his
      courage, and who, in mere spite, insisted on selling him for that
      ridiculous sum: or, in other words, on giving him away. Plornish, going up
      this yard alone and leaving his Principal outside, found a gentleman with
      tight drab legs, a rather old hat, a little hooked stick, and a blue
      neckerchief (Captain Maroon of Gloucestershire, a private friend of
      Captain Barbary); who happened to be there, in a friendly way, to mention
      these little circumstances concerning the remarkably fine grey gelding to
      any real judge of a horse and quick snapper-up of a good thing, who might
      look in at that address as per advertisement. This gentleman, happening
      also to be the Plaintiff in the Tip case, referred Mr Plornish to his
      solicitor, and declined to treat with Mr Plornish, or even to endure his
      presence in the yard, unless he appeared there with a twenty-pound note:
      in which case only, the gentleman would augur from appearances that he
      meant business, and might be induced to talk to him. On this hint, Mr
      Plornish retired to communicate with his Principal, and presently came
      back with the required credentials. Then said Captain Maroon, ‘Now, how
      much time do you want to make the other twenty in? Now, I’ll give you a
      month.’ Then said Captain Maroon, when that wouldn’t suit, ‘Now, I’ll tell
      what I’ll do with you. You shall get me a good bill at four months, made
      payable at a banking-house, for the other twenty!’ Then said Captain
      Maroon, when <i>that</i> wouldn’t suit, ‘Now, come; Here’s the last I’ve
      got to say to you. You shall give me another ten down, and I’ll run my pen
      clean through it.’ Then said Captain Maroon when <i>that</i> wouldn’t
      suit, ‘Now, I’ll tell you what it is, and this shuts it up; he has used me
      bad, but I’ll let him off for another five down and a bottle of wine; and
      if you mean done, say done, and if you don’t like it, leave it.’ Finally
      said Captain Maroon, when <i>that</i> wouldn’t suit either, ‘Hand over,
      then!’—And in consideration of the first offer, gave a receipt in
      full and discharged the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Plornish,’ said Arthur, ‘I trust to you, if you please, to keep my
      secret. If you will undertake to let the young man know that he is free,
      and to tell him that you were employed to compound for the debt by some
      one whom you are not at liberty to name, you will not only do me a
      service, but may do him one, and his sister also.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The last reason, sir,’ said Plornish, ‘would be quite sufficient. Your
      wishes shall be attended to.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A Friend has obtained his discharge, you can say if you please. A Friend
      who hopes that for his sister’s sake, if for no one else’s, he will make
      good use of his liberty.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your wishes, sir, shall be attended to.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if you will be so good, in your better knowledge of the family, as to
      communicate freely with me, and to point out to me any means by which you
      think I may be delicately and really useful to Little Dorrit, I shall feel
      under an obligation to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t name it, sir,’ returned Plornish, ‘it’ll be ekally a pleasure an a—it’l
      be ekally a pleasure and a—’ Finding himself unable to balance his
      sentence after two efforts, Mr Plornish wisely dropped it. He took
      Clennam’s card and appropriate pecuniary compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was earnest to finish his commission at once, and his Principal was in
      the same mind. So his Principal offered to set him down at the Marshalsea
      Gate, and they drove in that direction over Blackfriars Bridge. On the
      way, Arthur elicited from his new friend a confused summary of the
      interior life of Bleeding Heart Yard. They was all hard up there, Mr
      Plornish said, uncommon hard up, to be sure. Well, he couldn’t say how it
      was; he didn’t know as anybody <i>could</i> say how it was; all he know’d
      was, that so it was. When a man felt, on his own back and in his own
      belly, that poor he was, that man (Mr Plornish gave it as his decided
      belief) know’d well that he was poor somehow or another, and you couldn’t
      talk it out of him, no more than you could talk Beef into him. Then you
      see, some people as was better off said, and a good many such people lived
      pretty close up to the mark themselves if not beyond it so he’d heerd,
      that they was ‘improvident’ (that was the favourite word) down the Yard.
      For instance, if they see a man with his wife and children going to
      Hampton Court in a Wan, perhaps once in a year, they says, ‘Hallo! I
      thought you was poor, my improvident friend!’ Why, Lord, how hard it was
      upon a man! What was a man to do? He couldn’t go mollancholy mad, and even
      if he did, you wouldn’t be the better for it. In Mr Plornish’s judgment
      you would be the worse for it. Yet you seemed to want to make a man
      mollancholy mad. You was always at it—if not with your right hand,
      with your left. What was they a doing in the Yard? Why, take a look at ‘em
      and see. There was the girls and their mothers a working at their sewing,
      or their shoe-binding, or their trimming, or their waistcoat making, day
      and night and night and day, and not more than able to keep body and soul
      together after all—often not so much. There was people of pretty
      well all sorts of trades you could name, all wanting to work, and yet not
      able to get it. There was old people, after working all their lives, going
      and being shut up in the workhouse, much worse fed and lodged and treated
      altogether, than—Mr Plornish said manufacturers, but appeared to
      mean malefactors. Why, a man didn’t know where to turn himself for a crumb
      of comfort. As to who was to blame for it, Mr Plornish didn’t know who was
      to blame for it. He could tell you who suffered, but he couldn’t tell you
      whose fault it was. It wasn’t <i>his</i> place to find out, and who’d mind
      what he said, if he did find out? He only know’d that it wasn’t put right
      by them what undertook that line of business, and that it didn’t come
      right of itself. And, in brief, his illogical opinion was, that if you
      couldn’t do nothing for him, you had better take nothing from him for
      doing of it; so far as he could make out, that was about what it come to.
      Thus, in a prolix, gently-growling, foolish way, did Plornish turn the
      tangled skein of his estate about and about, like a blind man who was
      trying to find some beginning or end to it; until they reached the prison
      gate. There, he left his Principal alone; to wonder, as he rode away, how
      many thousand Plornishes there might be within a day or two’s journey of
      the Circumlocution Office, playing sundry curious variations on the same
      tune, which were not known by ear in that glorious institution.

<p>The mention of Mr Casby again revived in Clennam’s memory the smouldering
      embers of curiosity and interest which Mrs Flintwinch had fanned on the
      night of his arrival. Flora Casby had been the beloved of his boyhood; and
      Flora was the daughter and only child of wooden-headed old Christopher (so
      he was still occasionally spoken of by some irreverent spirits who had had
      dealings with him, and in whom familiarity had bred its proverbial result
      perhaps), who was reputed to be rich in weekly tenants, and to get a good
      quantity of blood out of the stones of several unpromising courts and
      alleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some days of inquiry and research, Arthur Clennam became convinced
      that the case of the Father of the Marshalsea was indeed a hopeless one,
      and sorrowfully resigned the idea of helping him to freedom again. He had
      no hopeful inquiry to make at present, concerning Little Dorrit either;
      but he argued with himself that it might—for anything he knew—it
      might be serviceable to the poor child, if he renewed this acquaintance.
      It is hardly necessary to add that beyond all doubt he would have
      presented himself at Mr Casby’s door, if there had been no Little Dorrit
      in existence; for we all know how we all deceive ourselves—that is
      to say, how people in general, our profounder selves excepted, deceive
      themselves—as to motives of action.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a comfortable impression upon him, and quite an honest one in its
      way, that he was still patronising Little Dorrit in doing what had no
      reference to her, he found himself one afternoon at the corner of Mr
      Casby’s street. Mr Casby lived in a street in the Gray’s Inn Road, which
      had set off from that thoroughfare with the intention of running at one
      heat down into the valley, and up again to the top of Pentonville Hill;
      but which had run itself out of breath in twenty yards, and had stood
      still ever since. There is no such place in that part now; but it remained
      there for many years, looking with a baulked countenance at the wilderness
      patched with unfruitful gardens and pimpled with eruptive summerhouses,
      that it had meant to run over in no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The house,’ thought Clennam, as he crossed to the door, ‘is as little
      changed as my mother’s, and looks almost as gloomy. But the likeness ends
      outside. I know its staid repose within. The smell of its jars of old
      rose-leaves and lavender seems to come upon me even here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When his knock at the bright brass knocker of obsolete shape brought a
      woman-servant to the door, those faded scents in truth saluted him like
      wintry breath that had a faint remembrance in it of the bygone spring. He
      stepped into the sober, silent, air-tight house—one might have
      fancied it to have been stifled by Mutes in the Eastern manner—and
      the door, closing again, seemed to shut out sound and motion. The
      furniture was formal, grave, and quaker-like, but well-kept; and had as
      prepossessing an aspect as anything, from a human creature to a wooden
      stool, that is meant for much use and is preserved for little, can ever
      wear. There was a grave clock, ticking somewhere up the staircase; and
      there was a songless bird in the same direction, pecking at his cage, as
      if he were ticking too. The parlour-fire ticked in the grate. There was
      only one person on the parlour-hearth, and the loud watch in his pocket
      ticked audibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant-maid had ticked the two words ‘Mr Clennam’ so softly that she
      had not been heard; and he consequently stood, within the door she had
      closed, unnoticed. The figure of a man advanced in life, whose smooth grey
      eyebrows seemed to move to the ticking as the fire-light flickered on
      them, sat in an arm-chair, with his list shoes on the rug, and his thumbs
      slowly revolving over one another. This was old Christopher Casby—recognisable
      at a glance—as unchanged in twenty years and upward as his own solid
      furniture—as little touched by the influence of the varying seasons
      as the old rose-leaves and old lavender in his porcelain jars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps there never was a man, in this troublesome world, so troublesome
      for the imagination to picture as a boy. And yet he had changed very
      little in his progress through life. Confronting him, in the room in which
      he sat, was a boy’s portrait, which anybody seeing him would have
      identified as Master Christopher Casby, aged ten: though disguised with a
      haymaking rake, for which he had had, at any time, as much taste or use as
      for a diving-bell; and sitting (on one of his own legs) upon a bank of
      violets, moved to precocious contemplation by the spire of a village
      church. There was the same smooth face and forehead, the same calm blue
      eye, the same placid air. The shining bald head, which looked so very
      large because it shone so much; and the long grey hair at its sides and
      back, like floss silk or spun glass, which looked so very benevolent
      because it was never cut; were not, of course, to be seen in the boy as in
      the old man. Nevertheless, in the Seraphic creature with the haymaking
      rake, were clearly to be discerned the rudiments of the Patriarch with the
      list shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patriarch was the name which many people delighted to give him. Various
      old ladies in the neighbourhood spoke of him as The Last of the
      Patriarchs. So grey, so slow, so quiet, so impassionate, so very bumpy in
      the head, Patriarch was the word for him. He had been accosted in the
      streets, and respectfully solicited to become a Patriarch for painters and
      for sculptors; with so much importunity, in sooth, that it would appear to
      be beyond the Fine Arts to remember the points of a Patriarch, or to
      invent one. Philanthropists of both sexes had asked who he was, and on
      being informed, ‘Old Christopher Casby, formerly Town-agent to Lord
      Decimus Tite Barnacle,’ had cried in a rapture of disappointment, ‘Oh!
      why, with that head, is he not a benefactor to his species! Oh! why, with
      that head, is he not a father to the orphan and a friend to the
      friendless!’ With that head, however, he remained old Christopher Casby,
      proclaimed by common report rich in house property; and with that head, he
      now sat in his silent parlour. Indeed it would be the height of unreason
      to expect him to be sitting there without that head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam moved to attract his attention, and the grey eyebrows
      turned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon,’ said Clennam, ‘I fear you did not hear me announced?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, I did not. Did you wish to see me, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wished to pay my respects.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Casby seemed a feather’s weight disappointed by the last words, having
      perhaps prepared himself for the visitor’s wishing to pay something else.
      ‘Have I the pleasure, sir,’ he proceeded—‘take a chair, if you
      please—have I the pleasure of knowing—? Ah! truly, yes, I
      think I have! I believe I am not mistaken in supposing that I am
      acquainted with those features? I think I address a gentleman of whose
      return to this country I was informed by Mr Flintwinch?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That is your present visitor.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really! Mr Clennam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No other, Mr Casby.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, I am glad to see you. How have you been since we met?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Without thinking it worth while to explain that in the course of some
      quarter of a century he had experienced occasional slight fluctuations in
      his health and spirits, Clennam answered generally that he had never been
      better, or something equally to the purpose; and shook hands with the
      possessor of ‘that head’ as it shed its patriarchal light upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We are older, Mr Clennam,’ said Christopher Casby.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We are—not younger,’ said Clennam. After this wise remark he felt
      that he was scarcely shining with brilliancy, and became aware that he was
      nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And your respected father,’ said Mr Casby, ‘is no more! I was grieved to
      hear it, Mr Clennam, I was grieved.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur replied in the usual way that he felt infinitely obliged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There was a time,’ said Mr Casby, ‘when your parents and myself were not
      on friendly terms. There was a little family misunderstanding among us.
      Your respected mother was rather jealous of her son, maybe; when I say her
      son, I mean your worthy self, your worthy self.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His smooth face had a bloom upon it like ripe wall-fruit. What with his
      blooming face, and that head, and his blue eyes, he seemed to be
      delivering sentiments of rare wisdom and virtue. In like manner, his
      physiognomical expression seemed to teem with benignity. Nobody could have
      said where the wisdom was, or where the virtue was, or where the benignity
      was; but they all seemed to be somewhere about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Those times, however,’ pursued Mr Casby, ‘are past and gone, past and
      gone. I do myself the pleasure of making a visit to your respected mother
      occasionally, and of admiring the fortitude and strength of mind with
      which she bears her trials, bears her trials.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he made one of these little repetitions, sitting with his hands
      crossed before him, he did it with his head on one side, and a gentle
      smile, as if he had something in his thoughts too sweetly profound to be
      put into words. As if he denied himself the pleasure of uttering it, lest
      he should soar too high; and his meekness therefore preferred to be
      unmeaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have heard that you were kind enough on one of those occasions,’ said
      Arthur, catching at the opportunity as it drifted past him, ‘to mention
      Little Dorrit to my mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little—? Dorrit? That’s the seamstress who was mentioned to me by a
      small tenant of mine? Yes, yes. Dorrit? That’s the name. Ah, yes, yes! You
      call her Little Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      No road in that direction. Nothing came of the cross-cut. It led no
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My daughter Flora,’ said Mr Casby, ‘as you may have heard probably, Mr
      Clennam, was married and established in life, several years ago. She had
      the misfortune to lose her husband when she had been married a few months.
      She resides with me again. She will be glad to see you, if you will permit
      me to let her know that you are here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By all means,’ returned Clennam. ‘I should have preferred the request, if
      your kindness had not anticipated me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Mr Casby rose up in his list shoes, and with a slow, heavy step
      (he was of an elephantine build), made for the door. He had a long
      wide-skirted bottle-green coat on, and a bottle-green pair of trousers,
      and a bottle-green waistcoat. The Patriarchs were not dressed in
      bottle-green broadcloth, and yet his clothes looked patriarchal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left the room, and allowed the ticking to become audible
      again, when a quick hand turned a latchkey in the house-door, opened it,
      and shut it. Immediately afterwards, a quick and eager short dark man came
      into the room with so much way upon him that he was within a foot of
      Clennam before he could stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Halloa!’ he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam saw no reason why he should not say ‘Halloa!’ too.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s the matter?’ said the short dark man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have not heard that anything is the matter,’ returned Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where’s Mr Casby?’ asked the short dark man, looking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He will be here directly, if you want him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>I</i> want him?’ said the short dark man. ‘Don’t you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This elicited a word or two of explanation from Clennam, during the
      delivery of which the short dark man held his breath and looked at him. He
      was dressed in black and rusty iron grey; had jet black beads of eyes; a
      scrubby little black chin; wiry black hair striking out from his head in
      prongs, like forks or hair-pins; and a complexion that was very dingy by
      nature, or very dirty by art, or a compound of nature and art. He had
      dirty hands and dirty broken nails, and looked as if he had been in the
      coals; he was in a perspiration, and snorted and sniffed and puffed and
      blew, like a little labouring steam-engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ said he, when Arthur told him how he came to be there. ‘Very well.
      That’s right. If he should ask for Pancks, will you be so good as to say
      that Pancks is come in?’ And so, with a snort and a puff, he worked out by
      another door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the old days at home, certain audacious doubts respecting the last
      of the Patriarchs, which were afloat in the air, had, by some forgotten
      means, come in contact with Arthur’s sensorium. He was aware of motes and
      specks of suspicion in the atmosphere of that time; seen through which
      medium, Christopher Casby was a mere Inn signpost, without any Inn—an
      invitation to rest and be thankful, when there was no place to put up at,
      and nothing whatever to be thankful for. He knew that some of these specks
      even represented Christopher as capable of harbouring designs in ‘that
      head,’ and as being a crafty impostor. Other motes there were which showed
      him as a heavy, selfish, drifting Booby, who, having stumbled, in the
      course of his unwieldy jostlings against other men, on the discovery that
      to get through life with ease and credit, he had but to hold his tongue,
      keep the bald part of his head well polished, and leave his hair alone,
      had had just cunning enough to seize the idea and stick to it. It was said
      that his being town-agent to Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle was referable, not
      to his having the least business capacity, but to his looking so supremely
      benignant that nobody could suppose the property screwed or jobbed under
      such a man; also, that for similar reasons he now got more money out of
      his own wretched lettings, unquestioned, than anybody with a less nobby
      and less shining crown could possibly have done. In a word, it was
      represented (Clennam called to mind, alone in the ticking parlour) that
      many people select their models, much as the painters, just now mentioned,
      select theirs; and that, whereas in the Royal Academy some evil old
      ruffian of a Dog-stealer will annually be found embodying all the cardinal
      virtues, on account of his eyelashes, or his chin, or his legs (thereby
      planting thorns of confusion in the breasts of the more observant students
      of nature), so, in the great social Exhibition, accessories are often
      accepted in lieu of the internal character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Calling these things to mind, and ranging Mr Pancks in a row with them,
      Arthur Clennam leaned this day to the opinion, without quite deciding on
      it, that the last of the Patriarchs was the drifting Booby aforesaid, with
      the one idea of keeping the bald part of his head highly polished: and
      that, much as an unwieldy ship in the Thames river may sometimes be seen
      heavily driving with the tide, broadside on, stern first, in its own way
      and in the way of everything else, though making a great show of
      navigation, when all of a sudden, a little coaly steam-tug will bear down
      upon it, take it in tow, and bustle off with it; similarly the cumbrous
      Patriarch had been taken in tow by the snorting Pancks, and was now
      following in the wake of that dingy little craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The return of Mr Casby with his daughter Flora, put an end to these
      meditations. Clennam’s eyes no sooner fell upon the subject of his old
      passion than it shivered and broke to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most men will be found sufficiently true to themselves to be true to an
      old idea. It is no proof of an inconstant mind, but exactly the opposite,
      when the idea will not bear close comparison with the reality, and the
      contrast is a fatal shock to it. Such was Clennam’s case. In his youth he
      had ardently loved this woman, and had heaped upon her all the locked-up
      wealth of his affection and imagination. That wealth had been, in his
      desert home, like Robinson Crusoe’s money; exchangeable with no one, lying
      idle in the dark to rust, until he poured it out for her. Ever since that
      memorable time, though he had, until the night of his arrival, as
      completely dismissed her from any association with his Present or Future
      as if she had been dead (which she might easily have been for anything he
      knew), he had kept the old fancy of the Past unchanged, in its old sacred
      place. And now, after all, the last of the Patriarchs coolly walked into
      the parlour, saying in effect, ‘Be good enough to throw it down and dance
      upon it. This is Flora.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, always tall, had grown to be very broad too, and short of breath;
      but that was not much. Flora, whom he had left a lily, had become a peony;
      but that was not much. Flora, who had seemed enchanting in all she said
      and thought, was diffuse and silly. That was much. Flora, who had been
      spoiled and artless long ago, was determined to be spoiled and artless
      now. That was a fatal blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is Flora!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sure,’ giggled Flora, tossing her head with a caricature of her
      girlish manner, such as a mummer might have presented at her own funeral,
      if she had lived and died in classical antiquity, ‘I am ashamed to see Mr
      Clennam, I am a mere fright, I know he’ll find me fearfully changed, I am
      actually an old woman, it’s shocking to be found out, it’s really
      shocking!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that she was just what he had expected and that time had
      not stood still with himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! But with a gentleman it’s so different and really you look so
      amazingly well that you have no right to say anything of the kind, while,
      as to me, you know—oh!’ cried Flora with a little scream, ‘I am
      dreadful!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patriarch, apparently not yet understanding his own part in the drama
      under representation, glowed with vacant serenity.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But if we talk of not having changed,’ said Flora, who, whatever she
      said, never once came to a full stop, ‘look at Papa, is not Papa precisely
      what he was when you went away, isn’t it cruel and unnatural of Papa to be
      such a reproach to his own child, if we go on in this way much longer
      people who don’t know us will begin to suppose that I am Papa’s Mama!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      That must be a long time hence, Arthur considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh Mr Clennam you insincerest of creatures,’ said Flora, ‘I perceive
      already you have not lost your old way of paying compliments, your old way
      when you used to pretend to be so sentimentally struck you know—at
      least I don’t mean that, I—oh I don’t know what I mean!’ Here Flora
      tittered confusedly, and gave him one of her old glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patriarch, as if he now began to perceive that his part in the piece
      was to get off the stage as soon as might be, rose, and went to the door
      by which Pancks had worked out, hailing that Tug by name. He received an
      answer from some little Dock beyond, and was towed out of sight directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You mustn’t think of going yet,’ said Flora—Arthur had looked at
      his hat, being in a ludicrous dismay, and not knowing what to do: ‘you
      could never be so unkind as to think of going, Arthur—I mean Mr
      Arthur—or I suppose Mr Clennam would be far more proper—but I
      am sure I don’t know what I am saying—without a word about the dear
      old days gone for ever, when I come to think of it I dare say it would be
      much better not to speak of them and it’s highly probable that you have
      some much more agreeable engagement and pray let Me be the last person in
      the world to interfere with it though there <i>was</i> a time, but I am
      running into nonsense again.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it possible that Flora could have been such a chatterer in the days
      she referred to? Could there have been anything like her present
      disjointed volubility in the fascinations that had captivated him?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed I have little doubt,’ said Flora, running on with astonishing
      speed, and pointing her conversation with nothing but commas, and very few
      of them, ‘that you are married to some Chinese lady, being in China so
      long and being in business and naturally desirous to settle and extend
      your connection nothing was more likely than that you should propose to a
      Chinese lady and nothing was more natural I am sure than that the Chinese
      lady should accept you and think herself very well off too, I only hope
      she’s not a Pagodian dissenter.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am not,’ returned Arthur, smiling in spite of himself, ‘married to any
      lady, Flora.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh good gracious me I hope you never kept yourself a bachelor so long on
      my account!’ tittered Flora; ‘but of course you never did why should you,
      pray don’t answer, I don’t know where I’m running to, oh do tell me
      something about the Chinese ladies whether their eyes are really so long
      and narrow always putting me in mind of mother-of-pearl fish at cards and
      do they really wear tails down their back and plaited too or is it only
      the men, and when they pull their hair so very tight off their foreheads
      don’t they hurt themselves, and why do they stick little bells all over
      their bridges and temples and hats and things or don’t they really do it?’ 
      Flora gave him another of her old glances. Instantly she went on again, as
      if he had spoken in reply for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then it’s all true and they really do! good gracious Arthur!—pray
      excuse me—old habit—Mr Clennam far more proper—what a
      country to live in for so long a time, and with so many lanterns and
      umbrellas too how very dark and wet the climate ought to be and no doubt
      actually is, and the sums of money that must be made by those two trades
      where everybody carries them and hangs them everywhere, the little shoes
      too and the feet screwed back in infancy is quite surprising, what a
      traveller you are!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his ridiculous distress, Clennam received another of the old glances
      without in the least knowing what to do with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear dear,’ said Flora, ‘only to think of the changes at home Arthur—cannot
      overcome it, and seems so natural, Mr Clennam far more proper—since
      you became familiar with the Chinese customs and language which I am
      persuaded you speak like a Native if not better for you were always quick
      and clever though immensely difficult no doubt, I am sure the tea chests
      alone would kill me if I tried, such changes Arthur—I am doing it
      again, seems so natural, most improper—as no one could have
      believed, who could have ever imagined Mrs Finching when I can’t imagine
      it myself!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is that your married name?’ asked Arthur, struck, in the midst of all
      this, by a certain warmth of heart that expressed itself in her tone when
      she referred, however oddly, to the youthful relation in which they had
      stood to one another. ‘Finching?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Finching oh yes isn’t it a dreadful name, but as Mr F. said when he
      proposed to me which he did seven times and handsomely consented I must
      say to be what he used to call on liking twelve months, after all, he
      wasn’t answerable for it and couldn’t help it could he, Excellent man, not
      at all like you but excellent man!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had at last talked herself out of breath for one moment. One moment;
      for she recovered breath in the act of raising a minute corner of her
      pocket-handkerchief to her eye, as a tribute to the ghost of the departed
      Mr F., and began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No one could dispute, Arthur—Mr Clennam—that it’s quite right
      you should be formally friendly to me under the altered circumstances and
      indeed you couldn’t be anything else, at least I suppose not you ought to
      know, but I can’t help recalling that there <i>was</i> a time when things
      were very different.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Mrs Finching,’ Arthur began, struck by the good tone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh not that nasty ugly name, say Flora!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flora. I assure you, Flora, I am happy in seeing you once more, and in
      finding that, like me, you have not forgotten the old foolish dreams, when
      we saw all before us in the light of our youth and hope.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t seem so,’ pouted Flora, ‘you take it very coolly, but however I
      know you are disappointed in me, I suppose the Chinese ladies—Mandarinesses
      if you call them so—are the cause or perhaps I am the cause myself,
      it’s just as likely.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no,’ Clennam entreated, ‘don’t say that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh I must you know,’ said Flora, in a positive tone, ‘what nonsense not
      to, I know I am not what you expected, I know that very well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of her rapidity, she had found that out with the quick
      perception of a cleverer woman. The inconsistent and profoundly
      unreasonable way in which she instantly went on, nevertheless, to
      interweave their long-abandoned boy and girl relations with their present
      interview, made Clennam feel as if he were light-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One remark,’ said Flora, giving their conversation, without the slightest
      notice and to the great terror of Clennam, the tone of a love-quarrel, ‘I
      wish to make, one explanation I wish to offer, when your Mama came and
      made a scene of it with my Papa and when I was called down into the little
      breakfast-room where they were looking at one another with your Mama’s
      parasol between them seated on two chairs like mad bulls what was I to
      do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Mrs Finching,’ urged Clennam—‘all so long ago and so long
      concluded, is it worth while seriously to—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can’t Arthur,’ returned Flora, ‘be denounced as heartless by the whole
      society of China without setting myself right when I have the opportunity
      of doing so, and you must be very well aware that there was Paul and
      Virginia which had to be returned and which was returned without note or
      comment, not that I mean to say you could have written to me watched as I
      was but if it had only come back with a red wafer on the cover I should
      have known that it meant Come to Pekin Nankeen and What’s the third place,
      barefoot.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Mrs Finching, you were not to blame, and I never blamed you. We
      were both too young, too dependent and helpless, to do anything but accept
      our separation.—Pray think how long ago,’ gently remonstrated
      Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One more remark,’ proceeded Flora with unslackened volubility, ‘I wish to
      make, one more explanation I wish to offer, for five days I had a cold in
      the head from crying which I passed entirely in the back drawing-room—there
      is the back drawing-room still on the first floor and still at the back of
      the house to confirm my words—when that dreary period had passed a
      lull succeeded years rolled on and Mr F. became acquainted with us at a
      mutual friend’s, he was all attention he called next day he soon began to
      call three evenings a week and to send in little things for supper it was
      not love on Mr F.‘s part it was adoration, Mr F. proposed with the full
      approval of Papa and what could I do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing whatever,’ said Arthur, with the cheerfulest readiness, ‘but what
      you did. Let an old friend assure you of his full conviction that you did
      quite right.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One last remark,’ proceeded Flora, rejecting commonplace life with a wave
      of her hand, ‘I wish to make, one last explanation I wish to offer, there
      <i>was</i> a time ere Mr F. first paid attentions incapable of being
      mistaken, but that is past and was not to be, dear Mr Clennam you no
      longer wear a golden chain you are free I trust you may be happy, here is
      Papa who is always tiresome and putting in his nose everywhere where he is
      not wanted.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and with a hasty gesture fraught with timid caution—such
      a gesture had Clennam’s eyes been familiar with in the old time—poor
      Flora left herself at eighteen years of age, a long long way behind again;
      and came to a full stop at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or rather, she left about half of herself at eighteen years of age behind,
      and grafted the rest on to the relict of the late Mr F.; thus making a
      moral mermaid of herself, which her once boy-lover contemplated with
      feelings wherein his sense of the sorrowful and his sense of the comical
      were curiously blended.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example. As if there were a secret understanding between herself and
      Clennam of the most thrilling nature; as if the first of a train of
      post-chaises and four, extending all the way to Scotland, were at that
      moment round the corner; and as if she couldn’t (and wouldn’t) have walked
      into the Parish Church with him, under the shade of the family umbrella,
      with the Patriarchal blessing on her head, and the perfect concurrence of
      all mankind; Flora comforted her soul with agonies of mysterious
      signalling, expressing dread of discovery. With the sensation of becoming
      more and more light-headed every minute, Clennam saw the relict of the
      late Mr F. enjoying herself in the most wonderful manner, by putting
      herself and him in their old places, and going through all the old
      performances—now, when the stage was dusty, when the scenery was
      faded, when the youthful actors were dead, when the orchestra was empty,
      when the lights were out. And still, through all this grotesque revival of
      what he remembered as having once been prettily natural to her, he could
      not but feel that it revived at sight of him, and that there was a tender
      memory in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patriarch insisted on his staying to dinner, and Flora signalled
      ‘Yes!’ Clennam so wished he could have done more than stay to dinner—so
      heartily wished he could have found the Flora that had been, or that never
      had been—that he thought the least atonement he could make for the
      disappointment he almost felt ashamed of, was to give himself up to the
      family desire. Therefore, he stayed to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pancks dined with them. Pancks steamed out of his little dock at a quarter
      before six, and bore straight down for the Patriarch, who happened to be
      then driving, in an inane manner, through a stagnant account of Bleeding
      Heart Yard. Pancks instantly made fast to him and hauled him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bleeding Heart Yard?’ said Pancks, with a puff and a snort. ‘It’s a
      troublesome property. Don’t pay you badly, but rents are very hard to get
      there. You have more trouble with that one place than with all the places
      belonging to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the big ship in tow gets the credit, with most spectators, of
      being the powerful object, so the Patriarch usually seemed to have said
      himself whatever Pancks said for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed?’ returned Clennam, upon whom this impression was so efficiently
      made by a mere gleam of the polished head that he spoke the ship instead
      of the Tug. ‘The people are so poor there?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>You</i> can’t say, you know,’ snorted Pancks, taking one of his dirty
      hands out of his rusty iron-grey pockets to bite his nails, if he could
      find any, and turning his beads of eyes upon his employer, ‘whether
      they’re poor or not. They say they are, but they all say that. When a man
      says he’s rich, you’re generally sure he isn’t. Besides, if they <i>are</i>
      poor, you can’t help it. You’d be poor yourself if you didn’t get your
      rents.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True enough,’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’re not going to keep open house for all the poor of London,’ pursued
      Pancks. ‘You’re not going to lodge ‘em for nothing. You’re not going to
      open your gates wide and let ‘em come free. Not if you know it, you
      ain’t.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Casby shook his head, in Placid and benignant generality.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If a man takes a room of you at half-a-crown a week, and when the week
      comes round hasn’t got the half-crown, you say to that man, Why have you
      got the room, then? If you haven’t got the one thing, why have you got the
      other? What have you been and done with your money? What do you mean by
      it? What are you up to? That’s what <i>you</i> say to a man of that sort;
      and if you didn’t say it, more shame for you!’ Mr Pancks here made a
      singular and startling noise, produced by a strong blowing effort in the
      region of the nose, unattended by any result but that acoustic one.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have some extent of such property about the east and north-east here,
      I believe?’ said Clennam, doubtful which of the two to address.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, pretty well,’ said Pancks. ‘You’re not particular to east or
      north-east, any point of the compass will do for you. What you want is a
      good investment and a quick return. You take it where you can find it. You
      ain’t nice as to situation—not you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fourth and most original figure in the Patriarchal tent, who
      also appeared before dinner. This was an amazing little old woman, with a
      face like a staring wooden doll too cheap for expression, and a stiff
      yellow wig perched unevenly on the top of her head, as if the child who
      owned the doll had driven a tack through it anywhere, so that it only got
      fastened on. Another remarkable thing in this little old woman was, that
      the same child seemed to have damaged her face in two or three places with
      some blunt instrument in the nature of a spoon; her countenance, and
      particularly the tip of her nose, presenting the phenomena of several
      dints, generally answering to the bowl of that article. A further
      remarkable thing in this little old woman was, that she had no name but Mr
      F.‘s Aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke upon the visitor’s view under the following circumstances: Flora
      said when the first dish was being put on the table, perhaps Mr Clennam
      might not have heard that Mr F. had left her a legacy? Clennam in return
      implied his hope that Mr F. had endowed the wife whom he adored, with the
      greater part of his worldly substance, if not with all. Flora said, oh
      yes, she didn’t mean that, Mr F. had made a beautiful will, but he had
      left her as a separate legacy, his Aunt. She then went out of the room to
      fetch the legacy, and, on her return, rather triumphantly presented ‘Mr
      F.‘s Aunt.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The major characteristics discoverable by the stranger in Mr F.‘s Aunt,
      were extreme severity and grim taciturnity; sometimes interrupted by a
      propensity to offer remarks in a deep warning voice, which, being totally
      uncalled for by anything said by anybody, and traceable to no association
      of ideas, confounded and terrified the Mind. Mr F.‘s Aunt may have thrown
      in these observations on some system of her own, and it may have been
      ingenious, or even subtle: but the key to it was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neatly-served and well-cooked dinner (for everything about the
      Patriarchal household promoted quiet digestion) began with some soup, some
      fried soles, a butter-boat of shrimp sauce, and a dish of potatoes. The
      conversation still turned on the receipt of rents. Mr F.‘s Aunt, after
      regarding the company for ten minutes with a malevolent gaze, delivered
      the following fearful remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When we lived at Henley, Barnes’s gander was stole by tinkers.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks courageously nodded his head and said, ‘All right, ma’am.’ But
      the effect of this mysterious communication upon Clennam was absolutely to
      frighten him. And another circumstance invested this old lady with
      peculiar terrors. Though she was always staring, she never acknowledged
      that she saw any individual. The polite and attentive stranger would
      desire, say, to consult her inclinations on the subject of potatoes. His
      expressive action would be hopelessly lost upon her, and what could he do?
      No man could say, ‘Mr F.‘s Aunt, will you permit me?’ Every man retired
      from the spoon, as Clennam did, cowed and baffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was mutton, a steak, and an apple-pie—nothing in the remotest
      way connected with ganders—and the dinner went on like a
      disenchanted feast, as it truly was. Once upon a time Clennam had sat at
      that table taking no heed of anything but Flora; now the principal heed he
      took of Flora was to observe, against his will, that she was very fond of
      porter, that she combined a great deal of sherry with sentiment, and that
      if she were a little overgrown, it was upon substantial grounds. The last
      of the Patriarchs had always been a mighty eater, and he disposed of an
      immense quantity of solid food with the benignity of a good soul who was
      feeding some one else. Mr Pancks, who was always in a hurry, and who
      referred at intervals to a little dirty notebook which he kept beside him
      (perhaps containing the names of the defaulters he meant to look up by way
      of dessert), took in his victuals much as if he were coaling; with a good
      deal of noise, a good deal of dropping about, and a puff and a snort
      occasionally, as if he were nearly ready to steam away.
    </p>

      All through dinner, Flora combined her present appetite for eating and
      drinking with her past appetite for romantic love, in a way that made
      Clennam afraid to lift his eyes from his plate; since he could not look
      towards her without receiving some glance of mysterious meaning or
      warning, as if they were engaged in a plot. Mr F.‘s Aunt sat silently
      defying him with an aspect of the greatest bitterness, until the removal
      of the cloth and the appearance of the decanters, when she originated
      another observation—struck into the conversation like a clock,
      without consulting anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora had just said, ‘Mr Clennam, will you give me a glass of port for Mr
      F.‘s Aunt?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Monument near London Bridge,’ that lady instantly proclaimed, ‘was
      put up arter the Great Fire of London; and the Great Fire of London was
      not the fire in which your uncle George’s workshops was burned down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks, with his former courage, said, ‘Indeed, ma’am? All right!’ But
      appearing to be incensed by imaginary contradiction, or other ill-usage,
      Mr F.‘s Aunt, instead of relapsing into silence, made the following
      additional proclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hate a fool!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She imparted to this sentiment, in itself almost Solomonic, so extremely
      injurious and personal a character by levelling it straight at the
      visitor’s head, that it became necessary to lead Mr F.‘s Aunt from the
      room. This was quietly done by Flora; Mr F.‘s Aunt offering no resistance,
      but inquiring on her way out, ‘What he come there for, then?’ with
      implacable animosity.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

      <a href="images/0151.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      When Flora returned, she explained that her legacy was a clever old lady,
      but was sometimes a little singular, and ‘took dislikes’—peculiarities
      of which Flora seemed to be proud rather than otherwise. As Flora’s good
      nature shone in the case, Clennam had no fault to find with the old lady
      for eliciting it, now that he was relieved from the terrors of her
      presence; and they took a glass or two of wine in peace. Foreseeing then
      that the Pancks would shortly get under weigh, and that the Patriarch
      would go to sleep, he pleaded the necessity of visiting his mother, and
      asked Mr Pancks in which direction he was going?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Citywards, sir,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Shall we walk together?’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite agreeable,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Flora was murmuring in rapid snatches for his ear, that there
      was a time and that the past was a yawning gulf however and that a golden
      chain no longer bound him and that she revered the memory of the late Mr
      F. and that she should be at home to-morrow at half-past one and that the
      decrees of Fate were beyond recall and that she considered nothing so
      improbable as that he ever walked on the north-west side of Gray’s-Inn
      Gardens at exactly four o’clock in the afternoon. He tried at parting to
      give his hand in frankness to the existing Flora—not the vanished
      Flora, or the mermaid—but Flora wouldn’t have it, couldn’t have it,
      was wholly destitute of the power of separating herself and him from their
      bygone characters. He left the house miserably enough; and so much more
      light-headed than ever, that if it had not been his good fortune to be
      towed away, he might, for the first quarter of an hour, have drifted
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he began to come to himself, in the cooler air and the absence of
      Flora, he found Pancks at full speed, cropping such scanty pasturage of
      nails as he could find, and snorting at intervals. These, in conjunction
      with one hand in his pocket and his roughened hat hind side before, were
      evidently the conditions under which he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A fresh night!’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, it’s pretty fresh,’ assented Pancks. ‘As a stranger you feel the
      climate more than I do, I dare say. Indeed I haven’t got time to feel it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You lead such a busy life?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I have always some of ‘em to look up, or something to look after.
      But I like business,’ said Pancks, getting on a little faster. ‘What’s a
      man made for?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For nothing else?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pancks put the counter question, ‘What else?’ It packed up, in the
      smallest compass, a weight that had rested on Clennam’s life; and he made
      no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s what I ask our weekly tenants,’ said Pancks. ‘Some of ‘em will
      pull long faces to me, and say, Poor as you see us, master, we’re always
      grinding, drudging, toiling, every minute we’re awake. I say to them, What
      else are you made for? It shuts them up. They haven’t a word to answer.
      What else are you made for? That clinches it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah dear, dear, dear!’ sighed Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here am I,’ said Pancks, pursuing his argument with the weekly tenant.
      ‘What else do you suppose I think I am made for? Nothing. Rattle me out of
      bed early, set me going, give me as short a time as you like to bolt my
      meals in, and keep me at it. Keep me always at it, and I’ll keep you
      always at it, you keep somebody else always at it. There you are with the
      Whole Duty of Man in a commercial country.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had walked a little further in silence, Clennam said: ‘Have you
      no taste for anything, Mr Pancks?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s taste?’ drily retorted Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let us say inclination.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have an inclination to get money, sir,’ said Pancks, ‘if you will show
      me how.’ He blew off that sound again, and it occurred to his companion
      for the first time that it was his way of laughing. He was a singular man
      in all respects; he might not have been quite in earnest, but that the
      short, hard, rapid manner in which he shot out these cinders of
      principles, as if it were done by mechanical revolvency, seemed
      irreconcilable with banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are no great reader, I suppose?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never read anything but letters and accounts. Never collect anything but
      advertisements relative to next of kin. If <i>that’s</i> a taste, I have
      got that. You’re not of the Clennams of Cornwall, Mr Clennam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not that I ever heard of.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know you’re not. I asked your mother, sir. She has too much character
      to let a chance escape her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Supposing I had been of the Clennams of Cornwall?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’d have heard of something to your advantage.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed! I have heard of little enough to my advantage for some time.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There’s a Cornish property going a begging, sir, and not a Cornish
      Clennam to have it for the asking,’ said Pancks, taking his note-book from
      his breast pocket and putting it in again. ‘I turn off here. I wish you
      good night.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good night!’ said Clennam. But the Tug, suddenly lightened, and
      untrammelled by having any weight in tow, was already puffing away into
      the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had crossed Smithfield together, and Clennam was left alone at the
      corner of Barbican. He had no intention of presenting himself in his
      mother’s dismal room that night, and could not have felt more depressed
      and cast away if he had been in a wilderness. He turned slowly down
      Aldersgate Street, and was pondering his way along towards Saint Paul’s,
      purposing to come into one of the great thoroughfares for the sake of
      their light and life, when a crowd of people flocked towards him on the
      same pavement, and he stood aside against a shop to let them pass. As they
      came up, he made out that they were gathered around a something that was
      carried on men’s shoulders. He soon saw that it was a litter, hastily made
      of a shutter or some such thing; and a recumbent figure upon it, and the
      scraps of conversation in the crowd, and a muddy bundle carried by one
      man, and a muddy hat carried by another, informed him that an accident had
      occurred. The litter stopped under a lamp before it had passed him
      half-a-dozen paces, for some readjustment of the burden; and, the crowd
      stopping too, he found himself in the midst of the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An accident going to the Hospital?’ he asked an old man beside him, who
      stood shaking his head, inviting conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,’ said the man, ‘along of them Mails. They ought to be prosecuted and
      fined, them Mails. They come a racing out of Lad Lane and Wood Street at
      twelve or fourteen mile a hour, them Mails do. The only wonder is, that
      people ain’t killed oftener by them Mails.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This person is not killed, I hope?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know!’ said the man, ‘it an’t for the want of a will in them
      Mails, if he an’t.’ The speaker having folded his arms, and set in
      comfortably to address his depreciation of them Mails to any of the
      bystanders who would listen, several voices, out of pure sympathy with the
      sufferer, confirmed him; one voice saying to Clennam, ‘They’re a public
      nuisance, them Mails, sir;’ another, ‘<i>I</i> see one on ‘em pull up
      within half a inch of a boy, last night;’ another, ‘<i>I</i> see one on
      ‘em go over a cat, sir—and it might have been your own mother;’ and
      all representing, by implication, that if he happened to possess any
      public influence, he could not use it better than against them Mails.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, a native Englishman is put to it every night of his life, to save
      his life from them Mails,’ argued the first old man; ‘and <i>he</i> knows
      when they’re a coming round the corner, to tear him limb from limb. What
      can you expect from a poor foreigner who don’t know nothing about ‘em!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is this a foreigner?’ said Clennam, leaning forward to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of such replies as ‘Frenchman, sir,’ ‘Porteghee, sir,’ 
      ‘Dutchman, sir,’ ‘Prooshan, sir,’ and other conflicting testimony, he now
      heard a feeble voice asking, both in Italian and in French, for water. A
      general remark going round, in reply, of ‘Ah, poor fellow, he says he’ll
      never get over it; and no wonder!’ Clennam begged to be allowed to pass,
      as he understood the poor creature. He was immediately handed to the
      front, to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘First, he wants some water,’ said he, looking round. (A dozen good
      fellows dispersed to get it.) ‘Are you badly hurt, my friend?’ he asked
      the man on the litter, in Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, sir; yes, yes, yes. It’s my leg, it’s my leg. But it pleases me to
      hear the old music, though I am very bad.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are a traveller! Stay! See, the water! Let me give you some.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They had rested the litter on a pile of paving stones. It was at a
      convenient height from the ground, and by stooping he could lightly raise
      the head with one hand and hold the glass to his lips with the other. A
      little, muscular, brown man, with black hair and white teeth. A lively
      face, apparently. Earrings in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s well. You are a traveller?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Surely, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A stranger in this city?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Surely, surely, altogether. I am arrived this unhappy evening.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘From what country?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Marseilles.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, see there! I also! Almost as much a stranger here as you, though
      born here, I came from Marseilles a little while ago. Don’t be cast down.’ 
      The face looked up at him imploringly, as he rose from wiping it, and
      gently replaced the coat that covered the writhing figure. ‘I won’t leave
      you till you shall be well taken care of. Courage! You will be very much
      better half an hour hence.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! Altro, Altro!’ cried the poor little man, in a faintly incredulous
      tone; and as they took him up, hung out his right hand to give the
      forefinger a back-handed shake in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam turned; and walking beside the litter, and saying an
      encouraging word now and then, accompanied it to the neighbouring hospital
      of Saint Bartholomew. None of the crowd but the bearers and he being
      admitted, the disabled man was soon laid on a table in a cool, methodical
      way, and carefully examined by a surgeon who was as near at hand, and as
      ready to appear as Calamity herself. ‘He hardly knows an English word,’ 
      said Clennam; ‘is he badly hurt?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let us know all about it first,’ said the surgeon, continuing his
      examination with a businesslike delight in it, ‘before we pronounce.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      After trying the leg with a finger, and two fingers, and one hand and two
      hands, and over and under, and up and down, and in this direction and in
      that, and approvingly remarking on the points of interest to another
      gentleman who joined him, the surgeon at last clapped the patient on the
      shoulder, and said, ‘He won’t hurt. He’ll do very well. It’s difficult
      enough, but we shall not want him to part with his leg this time.’ Which
      Clennam interpreted to the patient, who was full of gratitude, and, in his
      demonstrative way, kissed both the interpreter’s hand and the surgeon’s
      several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s a serious injury, I suppose?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ye-es,’ replied the surgeon, with the thoughtful pleasure of an artist
      contemplating the work upon his easel. ‘Yes, it’s enough. There’s a
      compound fracture above the knee, and a dislocation below. They are both
      of a beautiful kind.’ He gave the patient a friendly clap on the shoulder
      again, as if he really felt that he was a very good fellow indeed, and
      worthy of all commendation for having broken his leg in a manner
      interesting to science.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He speaks French?’ said the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes, he speaks French.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He’ll be at no loss here, then.—You have only to bear a little pain
      like a brave fellow, my friend, and to be thankful that all goes as well
      as it does,’ he added, in that tongue, ‘and you’ll walk again to a marvel.
      Now, let us see whether there’s anything else the matter, and how our ribs
      are?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else the matter, and our ribs were sound. Clennam
      remained until everything possible to be done had been skilfully and
      promptly done—the poor belated wanderer in a strange land movingly
      besought that favour of him—and lingered by the bed to which he was
      in due time removed, until he had fallen into a doze. Even then he wrote a
      few words for him on his card, with a promise to return to-morrow, and
      left it to be given to him when he should awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these proceedings occupied so long that it struck eleven o’clock at
      night as he came out at the Hospital Gate. He had hired a lodging for the
      present in Covent Garden, and he took the nearest way to that quarter, by
      Snow Hill and Holborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself again, after the solicitude and compassion of his last
      adventure, he was naturally in a thoughtful mood. As naturally, he could
      not walk on thinking for ten minutes without recalling Flora. She
      necessarily recalled to him his life, with all its misdirection and little
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he got to his lodging, he sat down before the dying fire, as he had
      stood at the window of his old room looking out upon the blackened forest
      of chimneys, and turned his gaze back upon the gloomy vista by which he
      had come to that stage in his existence. So long, so bare, so blank. No
      childhood; no youth, except for one remembrance; that one remembrance
      proved, only that day, to be a piece of folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a misfortune to him, trifle as it might have been to another. For,
      while all that was hard and stern in his recollection, remained Reality on
      being proved—was obdurate to the sight and touch, and relaxed
      nothing of its old indomitable grimness—the one tender recollection
      of his experience would not bear the same test, and melted away. He had
      foreseen this, on the former night, when he had dreamed with waking eyes,
      but he had not felt it then; and he had now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a dreamer in such wise, because he was a man who had, deep-rooted
      in his nature, a belief in all the gentle and good things his life had
      been without. Bred in meanness and hard dealing, this had rescued him to
      be a man of honourable mind and open hand. Bred in coldness and severity,
      this had rescued him to have a warm and sympathetic heart. Bred in a creed
      too darkly audacious to pursue, through its process of reserving the
      making of man in the image of his Creator to the making of his Creator in
      the image of an erring man, this had rescued him to judge not, and in
      humility to be merciful, and have hope and charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this saved him still from the whimpering weakness and cruel
      selfishness of holding that because such a happiness or such a virtue had
      not come into his little path, or worked well for him, therefore it was
      not in the great scheme, but was reducible, when found in appearance, to
      the basest elements. A disappointed mind he had, but a mind too firm and
      healthy for such unwholesome air. Leaving himself in the dark, it could
      rise into the light, seeing it shine on others and hailing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, he sat before his dying fire, sorrowful to think upon the way
      by which he had come to that night, yet not strewing poison on the way by
      which other men had come to it. That he should have missed so much, and at
      his time of life should look so far about him for any staff to bear him
      company upon his downward journey and cheer it, was a just regret. He
      looked at the fire from which the blaze departed, from which the afterglow
      subsided, in which the ashes turned grey, from which they dropped to dust,
      and thought, ‘How soon I too shall pass through such changes, and be
      gone!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To review his life was like descending a green tree in fruit and flower,
      and seeing all the branches wither and drop off, one by one, as he came
      down towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘From the unhappy suppression of my youngest days, through the rigid and
      unloving home that followed them, through my departure, my long exile, my
      return, my mother’s welcome, my intercourse with her since, down to the
      afternoon of this day with poor Flora,’ said Arthur Clennam, ‘what have I
      found!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His door was softly opened, and these spoken words startled him, and came
      as if they were an answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />

	</hgroup>
<p>Arthur Clennam rose hastily, and saw her standing at the door. This
      history must sometimes see with Little Dorrit’s eyes, and shall begin that
      course by seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit looked into a dim room, which seemed a spacious one to her,
      and grandly furnished. Courtly ideas of Covent Garden, as a place with
      famous coffee-houses, where gentlemen wearing gold-laced coats and swords
      had quarrelled and fought duels; costly ideas of Covent Garden, as a place
      where there were flowers in winter at guineas a-piece, pine-apples at
      guineas a pound, and peas at guineas a pint; picturesque ideas of Covent
      Garden, as a place where there was a mighty theatre, showing wonderful and
      beautiful sights to richly-dressed ladies and gentlemen, and which was for
      ever far beyond the reach of poor Fanny or poor uncle; desolate ideas of
      Covent Garden, as having all those arches in it, where the miserable
      children in rags among whom she had just now passed, like young rats,
      slunk and hid, fed on offal, huddled together for warmth, and were hunted
      about (look to the rats young and old, all ye Barnacles, for before God
      they are eating away our foundations, and will bring the roofs on our
      heads!); teeming ideas of Covent Garden, as a place of past and present
      mystery, romance, abundance, want, beauty, ugliness, fair country gardens,
      and foul street gutters; all confused together,—made the room dimmer
      than it was in Little Dorrit’s eyes, as they timidly saw it from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first in the chair before the gone-out fire, and then turned round
      wondering to see her, was the gentleman whom she sought. The brown, grave
      gentleman, who smiled so pleasantly, who was so frank and considerate in
      his manner, and yet in whose earnestness there was something that reminded
      her of his mother, with the great difference that she was earnest in
      asperity and he in gentleness. Now he regarded her with that attentive and
      inquiring look before which Little Dorrit’s eyes had always fallen, and
      before which they fell still.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My poor child! Here at midnight?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I said Little Dorrit, sir, on purpose to prepare you. I knew you must be
      very much surprised.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you alone?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No sir, I have got Maggy with me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering her entrance sufficiently prepared for by this mention of her
      name, Maggy appeared from the landing outside, on the broad grin. She
      instantly suppressed that manifestation, however, and became fixedly
      solemn.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I have no fire,’ said Clennam. ‘And you are—’ He was going to
      say so lightly clad, but stopped himself in what would have been a
      reference to her poverty, saying instead, ‘And it is so cold.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the chair from which he had risen nearer to the grate, he made her
      sit down in it; and hurriedly bringing wood and coal, heaped them together
      and got a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your foot is like marble, my child;’ he had happened to touch it, while
      stooping on one knee at his work of kindling the fire; ‘put it nearer the
      warmth.’ Little Dorrit thanked him hastily. It was quite warm, it was very
      warm! It smote upon his heart to feel that she hid her thin, worn shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit was not ashamed of her poor shoes. He knew her story, and it
      was not that. Little Dorrit had a misgiving that he might blame her
      father, if he saw them; that he might think, ‘why did he dine to-day, and
      leave this little creature to the mercy of the cold stones!’ She had no
      belief that it would have been a just reflection; she simply knew, by
      experience, that such delusions did sometimes present themselves to
      people. It was a part of her father’s misfortunes that they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Before I say anything else,’ Little Dorrit began, sitting before the pale
      fire, and raising her eyes again to the face which in its harmonious look
      of interest, and pity, and protection, she felt to be a mystery far above
      her in degree, and almost removed beyond her guessing at; ‘may I tell you
      something, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, my child.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shade of distress fell upon her, at his so often calling her a
      child. She was surprised that he should see it, or think of such a slight
      thing; but he said directly:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wanted a tender word, and could think of no other. As you just now gave
      yourself the name they give you at my mother’s, and as that is the name by
      which I always think of you, let me call you Little Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir, I should like it better than any name.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little mother,’ Maggy (who had been falling asleep) put in, as a
      correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s all the same, Maggy,’ returned Little Dorrit, ‘all the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it all the same, mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggy laughed, and immediately snored. In Little Dorrit’s eyes and ears,
      the uncouth figure and the uncouth sound were as pleasant as could be.
      There was a glow of pride in her big child, overspreading her face, when
      it again met the eyes of the grave brown gentleman. She wondered what he
      was thinking of, as he looked at Maggy and her. She thought what a good
      father he would be. How, with some such look, he would counsel and cherish
      his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What I was going to tell you, sir,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘is, that my
      brother is at large.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur was rejoiced to hear it, and hoped he would do well.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what I was going to tell you, sir,’ said Little Dorrit, trembling in
      all her little figure and in her voice, ‘is, that I am not to know whose
      generosity released him—am never to ask, and am never to be told,
      and am never to thank that gentleman with all my grateful heart!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would probably need no thanks, Clennam said. Very likely he would be
      thankful himself (and with reason), that he had had the means and chance
      of doing a little service to her, who well deserved a great one.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what I was going to say, sir, is,’ said Little Dorrit, trembling more
      and more, ‘that if I knew him, and I might, I would tell him that he can
      never, never know how I feel his goodness, and how my good father would
      feel it. And what I was going to say, sir, is, that if I knew him, and I
      might—but I don’t know him and I must not—I know that!—I
      would tell him that I shall never any more lie down to sleep without
      having prayed to Heaven to bless him and reward him. And if I knew him,
      and I might, I would go down on my knees to him, and take his hand and
      kiss it and ask him not to draw it away, but to leave it—O to leave
      it for a moment—and let my thankful tears fall on it; for I have no
      other thanks to give him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit had put his hand to her lips, and would have kneeled to him,
      but he gently prevented her, and replaced her in her chair. Her eyes, and
      the tones of her voice, had thanked him far better than she thought. He
      was not able to say, quite as composedly as usual, ‘There, Little Dorrit,
      there, there, there! We will suppose that you did know this person, and
      that you might do all this, and that it was all done. And now tell me, Who
      am quite another person—who am nothing more than the friend who
      begged you to trust him—why you are out at midnight, and what it is
      that brings you so far through the streets at this late hour, my slight,
      delicate,’ child was on his lips again, ‘Little Dorrit!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Maggy and I have been to-night,’ she answered, subduing herself with the
      quiet effort that had long been natural to her, ‘to the theatre where my
      sister is engaged.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And oh ain’t it a Ev’nly place,’ suddenly interrupted Maggy, who seemed
      to have the power of going to sleep and waking up whenever she chose.
      ‘Almost as good as a hospital. Only there ain’t no Chicking in it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she shook herself, and fell asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We went there,’ said Little Dorrit, glancing at her charge, ‘because I
      like sometimes to know, of my own knowledge, that my sister is doing well;
      and like to see her there, with my own eyes, when neither she nor Uncle is
      aware. It is very seldom indeed that I can do that, because when I am not
      out at work, I am with my father, and even when I am out at work, I hurry
      home to him. But I pretend to-night that I am at a party.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she made the confession, timidly hesitating, she raised her eyes to the
      face, and read its expression so plainly that she answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh no, certainly! I never was at a party in my life.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a little under his attentive look, and then said, ‘I hope there
      is no harm in it. I could never have been of any use, if I had not
      pretended a little.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She feared that he was blaming her in his mind for so devising to contrive
      for them, think for them, and watch over them, without their knowledge or
      gratitude; perhaps even with their reproaches for supposed neglect. But
      what was really in his mind, was the weak figure with its strong purpose,
      the thin worn shoes, the insufficient dress, and the pretence of
      recreation and enjoyment. He asked where the suppositious party was? At a
      place where she worked, answered Little Dorrit, blushing. She had said
      very little about it; only a few words to make her father easy. Her father
      did not believe it to be a grand party—indeed he might suppose that.
      And she glanced for an instant at the shawl she wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is the first night,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘that I have ever been away
      from home. And London looks so large, so barren, and so wild.’ In Little
      Dorrit’s eyes, its vastness under the black sky was awful; a tremor passed
      over her as she said the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But this is not,’ she added, with the quiet effort again, ‘what I have
      come to trouble you with, sir. My sister’s having found a friend, a lady
      she has told me of and made me rather anxious about, was the first cause
      of my coming away from home. And being away, and coming (on purpose) round
      by where you lived and seeing a light in the window—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for the first time. No, not for the first time. In Little Dorrit’s
      eyes, the outside of that window had been a distant star on other nights
      than this. She had toiled out of her way, tired and troubled, to look up
      at it, and wonder about the grave, brown gentleman from so far off, who
      had spoken to her as a friend and protector.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There were three things,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘that I thought I would
      like to say, if you were alone and I might come up-stairs. First, what I
      have tried to say, but never can—never shall—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush, hush! That is done with, and disposed of. Let us pass to the
      second,’ said Clennam, smiling her agitation away, making the blaze shine
      upon her, and putting wine and cake and fruit towards her on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think,’ said Little Dorrit—‘this is the second thing, sir—I
      think Mrs Clennam must have found out my secret, and must know where I
      come from and where I go to. Where I live, I mean.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed!’ returned Clennam quickly. He asked her, after short
      consideration, why she supposed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think,’ replied Little Dorrit, ‘that Mr Flintwinch must have watched
      me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      And why, Clennam asked, as he turned his eyes upon the fire, bent his
      brows, and considered again; why did she suppose that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have met him twice. Both times near home. Both times at night, when I
      was going back. Both times I thought (though that may easily be my
      mistake), that he hardly looked as if he had met me by accident.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did he say anything?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No; he only nodded and put his head on one side.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The devil take his head!’ mused Clennam, still looking at the fire; ‘it’s
      always on one side.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to her lips, and to
      touch something to eat—it was very difficult, she was so timid and
      shy—and then said, musing again:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is my mother at all changed to you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, not at all. She is just the same. I wondered whether I had better
      tell her my history. I wondered whether I might—I mean, whether you
      would like me to tell her. I wondered,’ said Little Dorrit, looking at him
      in a suppliant way, and gradually withdrawing her eyes as he looked at
      her, ‘whether you would advise me what I ought to do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little Dorrit,’ said Clennam; and the phrase had already begun, between
      these two, to stand for a hundred gentle phrases, according to the varying
      tone and connection in which it was used; ‘do nothing. I will have some
      talk with my old friend, Mrs Affery. Do nothing, Little Dorrit—except
      refresh yourself with such means as there are here. I entreat you to do
      that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, I am not hungry. Nor,’ said Little Dorrit, as he softly put
      her glass towards her, ‘nor thirsty.—I think Maggy might like
      something, perhaps.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We will make her find pockets presently for all there is here,’ said
      Clennam: ‘but before we awake her, there was a third thing to say.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. You will not be offended, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I promise that, unreservedly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It will sound strange. I hardly know how to say it. Don’t think it
      unreasonable or ungrateful in me,’ said Little Dorrit, with returning and
      increasing agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no, no. I am sure it will be natural and right. I am not afraid that
      I shall put a wrong construction on it, whatever it is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you. You are coming back to see my father again?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have been so good and thoughtful as to write him a note, saying that
      you are coming to-morrow?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, that was nothing! Yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can you guess,’ said Little Dorrit, folding her small hands tight in one
      another, and looking at him with all the earnestness of her soul looking
      steadily out of her eyes, ‘what I am going to ask you not to do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think I can. But I may be wrong.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, you are not wrong,’ said Little Dorrit, shaking her head. ‘If we
      should want it so very, very badly that we cannot do without it, let me
      ask you for it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I Will,—I Will.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t encourage him to ask. Don’t understand him if he does ask. Don’t
      give it to him. Save him and spare him that, and you will be able to think
      better of him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam said—not very plainly, seeing those tears glistening in her
      anxious eyes—that her wish should be sacred with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t know what he is,’ she said; ‘you don’t know what he really is.
      How can you, seeing him there all at once, dear love, and not gradually,
      as I have done! You have been so good to us, so delicately and truly good,
      that I want him to be better in your eyes than in anybody’s. And I cannot
      bear to think,’ cried Little Dorrit, covering her tears with her hands, ‘I
      cannot bear to think that you of all the world should see him in his only
      moments of degradation.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray,’ said Clennam, ‘do not be so distressed. Pray, pray, Little Dorrit!
      This is quite understood now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir. Thank you! I have tried very much to keep myself from
      saying this; I have thought about it, days and nights; but when I knew for
      certain you were coming again, I made up my mind to speak to you. Not
      because I am ashamed of him,’ she dried her tears quickly, ‘but because I
      know him better than any one does, and love him, and am proud of him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Relieved of this weight, Little Dorrit was nervously anxious to be gone.
      Maggy being broad awake, and in the act of distantly gloating over the
      fruit and cakes with chuckles of anticipation, Clennam made the best
      diversion in his power by pouring her out a glass of wine, which she drank
      in a series of loud smacks; putting her hand upon her windpipe after every
      one, and saying, breathless, with her eyes in a prominent state, ‘Oh,
      ain’t it d’licious! Ain’t it hospitally!’ When she had finished the wine
      and these encomiums, he charged her to load her basket (she was never
      without her basket) with every eatable thing upon the table, and to take
      especial care to leave no scrap behind. Maggy’s pleasure in doing this and
      her little mother’s pleasure in seeing Maggy pleased, was as good a turn
      as circumstances could have given to the late conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But the gates will have been locked long ago,’ said Clennam, suddenly
      remembering it. ‘Where are you going?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am going to Maggy’s lodging,’ answered Little Dorrit. ‘I shall be quite
      safe, quite well taken care of.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I must accompany you there,’ said Clennam, ‘I cannot let you go alone.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, pray leave us to go there by ourselves. Pray do!’ begged Little
      Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so earnest in the petition, that Clennam felt a delicacy in
      obtruding himself upon her: the rather, because he could well understand
      that Maggy’s lodging was of the obscurest sort. ‘Come, Maggy,’ said Little
      Dorrit cheerily, ‘we shall do very well; we know the way by this time,
      Maggy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes, little mother; we know the way,’ chuckled Maggy. And away they
      went. Little Dorrit turned at the door to say, ‘God bless you!’ She said
      it very softly, but perhaps she may have been as audible above—who
      knows!—as a whole cathedral choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam suffered them to pass the corner of the street before he
      followed at a distance; not with any idea of encroaching a second time on
      Little Dorrit’s privacy, but to satisfy his mind by seeing her secure in
      the neighbourhood to which she was accustomed. So diminutive she looked,
      so fragile and defenceless against the bleak damp weather, flitting along
      in the shuffling shadow of her charge, that he felt, in his compassion,
      and in his habit of considering her a child apart from the rest of the
      rough world, as if he would have been glad to take her up in his arms and
      carry her to her journey’s end.
    </p>
    <p>
      In course of time she came into the leading thoroughfare where the
      Marshalsea was, and then he saw them slacken their pace, and soon turn
      down a by-street. He stopped, felt that he had no right to go further, and
      slowly left them. He had no suspicion that they ran any risk of being
      houseless until morning; had no idea of the truth until long, long
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, said Little Dorrit, when they stopped at a poor dwelling all in
      darkness, and heard no sound on listening at the door, ‘Now, this is a
      good lodging for you, Maggy, and we must not give offence. Consequently,
      we will only knock twice, and not very loud; and if we cannot wake them
      so, we must walk about till day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand, and listened. Twice,
      Little Dorrit knocked with a careful hand, and listened. All was close and
      still. ‘Maggy, we must do the best we can, my dear. We must be patient,
      and wait for day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a chill dark night, with a damp wind blowing, when they came out
      into the leading street again, and heard the clocks strike half-past one.
      ‘In only five hours and a half,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘we shall be able to
      go home.’ To speak of home, and to go and look at it, it being so near,
      was a natural sequence. They went to the closed gate, and peeped through
      into the court-yard. ‘I hope he is sound asleep,’ said Little Dorrit,
      kissing one of the bars, ‘and does not miss me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gate was so familiar, and so like a companion, that they put down
      Maggy’s basket in a corner to serve for a seat, and keeping close
      together, rested there for some time. While the street was empty and
      silent, Little Dorrit was not afraid; but when she heard a footstep at a
      distance, or saw a moving shadow among the street lamps, she was startled,
      and whispered, ‘Maggy, I see some one. Come away!’ Maggy would then wake
      up more or less fretfully, and they would wander about a little, and come
      back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as eating was a novelty and an amusement, Maggy kept up pretty
      well. But that period going by, she became querulous about the cold, and
      shivered and whimpered. ‘It will soon be over, dear,’ said Little Dorrit
      patiently. ‘Oh it’s all very fine for you, little mother,’ returned Maggy,
      ‘but I’m a poor thing, only ten years old.’ At last, in the dead of the
      night, when the street was very still indeed, Little Dorrit laid the heavy
      head upon her bosom, and soothed her to sleep. And thus she sat at the
      gate, as it were alone; looking up at the stars, and seeing the clouds
      pass over them in their wild flight—which was the dance at Little
      Dorrit’s party.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If it really was a party!’ she thought once, as she sat there. ‘If it was
      light and warm and beautiful, and it was our house, and my poor dear was
      its master, and had never been inside these walls. And if Mr Clennam was
      one of our visitors, and we were dancing to delightful music, and were all
      as gay and light-hearted as ever we could be! I wonder—’ Such a
      vista of wonder opened out before her, that she sat looking up at the
      stars, quite lost, until Maggy was querulous again, and wanted to get up
      and walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three o’clock, and half-past three, and they had passed over London
      Bridge. They had heard the rush of the tide against obstacles; and looked
      down, awed, through the dark vapour on the river; had seen little spots of
      lighted water where the bridge lamps were reflected, shining like demon
      eyes, with a terrible fascination in them for guilt and misery. They had
      shrunk past homeless people, lying coiled up in nooks. They had run from
      drunkards. They had started from slinking men, whistling and signing to
      one another at bye corners, or running away at full speed. Though
      everywhere the leader and the guide, Little Dorrit, happy for once in her
      youthful appearance, feigned to cling to and rely upon Maggy. And more
      than once some voice, from among a knot of brawling or prowling figures in
      their path, had called out to the rest to ‘let the woman and the child go
      by!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the woman and the child had gone by, and gone on, and five had sounded
      from the steeples. They were walking slowly towards the east, already
      looking for the first pale streak of day, when a woman came after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What are you doing with the child?’ she said to Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was young—far too young to be there, Heaven knows!—and
      neither ugly nor wicked-looking. She spoke coarsely, but with no naturally
      coarse voice; there was even something musical in its sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What are you doing with yourself?’ retorted Maggy, for want of a better
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can’t you see, without my telling you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know as I can,’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Killing myself! Now I have answered you, answer me. What are you doing
      with the child?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The supposed child kept her head drooped down, and kept her form close at
      Maggy’s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Poor thing!’ said the woman. ‘Have you no feeling, that you keep her out
      in the cruel streets at such a time as this? Have you no eyes, that you
      don’t see how delicate and slender she is? Have you no sense (you don’t
      look as if you had much) that you don’t take more pity on this cold and
      trembling little hand?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had stepped across to that side, and held the hand between her own
      two, chafing it. ‘Kiss a poor lost creature, dear,’ she said, bending her
      face, ‘and tell me where’s she taking you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit turned towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, my God!’ she said, recoiling, ‘you’re a woman!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t mind that!’ said Little Dorrit, clasping one of her hands that had
      suddenly released hers. ‘I am not afraid of you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you had better be,’ she answered. ‘Have you no mother?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No father?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, a very dear one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Go home to him, and be afraid of me. Let me go. Good night!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I must thank you first; let me speak to you as if I really were a child.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can’t do it,’ said the woman. ‘You are kind and innocent; but you
      can’t look at me out of a child’s eyes. I never should have touched you,
      but I thought that you were a child.’ And with a strange, wild cry, she
      went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      No day yet in the sky, but there was day in the resounding stones of the
      streets; in the waggons, carts, and coaches; in the workers going to
      various occupations; in the opening of early shops; in the traffic at
      markets; in the stir of the riverside. There was coming day in the flaring
      lights, with a feebler colour in them than they would have had at another
      time; coming day in the increased sharpness of the air, and the ghastly
      dying of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went back again to the gate, intending to wait there now until it
      should be opened; but the air was so raw and cold that Little Dorrit,
      leading Maggy about in her sleep, kept in motion. Going round by the
      Church, she saw lights there, and the door open; and went up the steps and
      looked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who’s that?’ cried a stout old man, who was putting on a nightcap as if
      he were going to bed in a vault.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s no one particular, sir,’ said Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stop!’ cried the man. ‘Let’s have a look at you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This caused her to turn back again in the act of going out, and to present
      herself and her charge before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought so!’ said he. ‘I know <i>you</i>.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We have often seen each other,’ said Little Dorrit, recognising the
      sexton, or the beadle, or the verger, or whatever he was, ‘when I have
      been at church here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘More than that, we’ve got your birth in our Register, you know; you’re
      one of our curiosities.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed!’ said Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To be sure. As the child of the—by-the-bye, how did you get out so
      early?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We were shut out last night, and are waiting to get in.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t mean it? And there’s another hour good yet! Come into the
      vestry. You’ll find a fire in the vestry, on account of the painters. I’m
      waiting for the painters, or I shouldn’t be here, you may depend upon it.
      One of our curiosities mustn’t be cold when we have it in our power to
      warm her up comfortable. Come along.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a very good old fellow, in his familiar way; and having stirred the
      vestry fire, he looked round the shelves of registers for a particular
      volume. ‘Here you are, you see,’ he said, taking it down and turning the
      leaves. ‘Here you’ll find yourself, as large as life. Amy, daughter of
      William and Fanny Dorrit. Born, Marshalsea Prison, Parish of St George.
      And we tell people that you have lived there, without so much as a day’s
      or a night’s absence, ever since. Is it true?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite true, till last night.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lord!’ But his surveying her with an admiring gaze suggested Something
      else to him, to wit: ‘I am sorry to see, though, that you are faint and
      tired. Stay a bit. I’ll get some cushions out of the church, and you and
      your friend shall lie down before the fire. Don’t be afraid of not going
      in to join your father when the gate opens. <i>I’ll</i> call you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon brought in the cushions, and strewed them on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There you are, you see. Again as large as life. Oh, never mind thanking.
      I’ve daughters of my own. And though they weren’t born in the Marshalsea
      Prison, they might have been, if I had been, in my ways of carrying on, of
      your father’s breed. Stop a bit. I must put something under the cushion
      for your head. Here’s a burial volume, just the thing! We have got Mrs
      Bangham in this book. But what makes these books interesting to most
      people is—not who’s in ‘em, but who isn’t—who’s coming, you
      know, and when. That’s the interesting question.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Commendingly looking back at the pillow he had improvised, he left them to
      their hour’s repose. Maggy was snoring already, and Little Dorrit was soon
      fast asleep with her head resting on that sealed book of Fate, untroubled
      by its mysterious blank leaves.
    </p>

    </h5>

    <p>
      This was Little Dorrit’s party. The shame, desertion, wretchedness, and
      exposure of the great capital; the wet, the cold, the slow hours, and the
      swift clouds of the dismal night. This was the party from which Little
      Dorrit went home, jaded, in the first grey mist of a rainy morning.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Mrs Flintwinch has another Dream</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>The debilitated old house in the city, wrapped in its mantle of soot, and
      leaning heavily on the crutches that had partaken of its decay and worn
      out with it, never knew a healthy or a cheerful interval, let what would
      betide. If the sun ever touched it, it was but with a ray, and that was
      gone in half an hour; if the moonlight ever fell upon it, it was only to
      put a few patches on its doleful cloak, and make it look more wretched.
      The stars, to be sure, coldly watched it when the nights and the smoke
      were clear enough; and all bad weather stood by it with a rare fidelity.
      You should alike find rain, hail, frost, and thaw lingering in that dismal
      enclosure when they had vanished from other places; and as to snow, you
      should see it there for weeks, long after it had changed from yellow to
      black, slowly weeping away its grimy life. The place had no other
      adherents. As to street noises, the rumbling of wheels in the lane merely
      rushed in at the gateway in going past, and rushed out again: making the
      listening Mistress Affery feel as if she were deaf, and recovered the
      sense of hearing by instantaneous flashes. So with whistling, singing,
      talking, laughing, and all pleasant human sounds. They leaped the gap in a
      moment, and went upon their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The varying light of fire and candle in Mrs Clennam’s room made the
      greatest change that ever broke the dead monotony of the spot. In her two
      long narrow windows, the fire shone sullenly all day, and sullenly all
      night. On rare occasions it flashed up passionately, as she did; but for
      the most part it was suppressed, like her, and preyed upon itself evenly
      and slowly. During many hours of the short winter days, however, when it
      was dusk there early in the afternoon, changing distortions of herself in
      her wheeled chair, of Mr Flintwinch with his wry neck, of Mistress Affery
      coming and going, would be thrown upon the house wall that was over the
      gateway, and would hover there like shadows from a great magic lantern. As
      the room-ridden invalid settled for the night, these would gradually
      disappear: Mistress Affery’s magnified shadow always flitting about, last,
      until it finally glided away into the air, as though she were off upon a
      witch excursion. Then the solitary light would burn unchangingly, until it
      burned pale before the dawn, and at last died under the breath of Mrs
      Affery, as her shadow descended on it from the witch-region of sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange, if the little sick-room fire were in effect a beacon fire,
      summoning some one, and that the most unlikely some one in the world, to
      the spot that <i>must</i> be come to. Strange, if the little sick-room
      light were in effect a watch-light, burning in that place every night
      until an appointed event should be watched out! Which of the vast
      multitude of travellers, under the sun and the stars, climbing the dusty
      hills and toiling along the weary plains, journeying by land and
      journeying by sea, coming and going so strangely, to meet and to act and
      react on one another; which of the host may, with no suspicion of the
      journey’s end, be travelling surely hither?
    </p>
    <p>
      Time shall show us. The post of honour and the post of shame, the
      general’s station and the drummer’s, a peer’s statue in Westminster Abbey
      and a seaman’s hammock in the bosom of the deep, the mitre and the
      workhouse, the woolsack and the gallows, the throne and the guillotine—the
      travellers to all are on the great high road, but it has wonderful
      divergencies, and only Time shall show us whither each traveller is bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a wintry afternoon at twilight, Mrs Flintwinch, having been heavy all
      day, dreamed this dream:
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought she was in the kitchen getting the kettle ready for tea, and
      was warming herself with her feet upon the fender and the skirt of her
      gown tucked up, before the collapsed fire in the middle of the grate,
      bordered on either hand by a deep cold black ravine. She thought that as
      she sat thus, musing upon the question whether life was not for some
      people a rather dull invention, she was frightened by a sudden noise
      behind her. She thought that she had been similarly frightened once last
      week, and that the noise was of a mysterious kind—a sound of
      rustling and of three or four quick beats like a rapid step; while a shock
      or tremble was communicated to her heart, as if the step had shaken the
      floor, or even as if she had been touched by some awful hand. She thought
      that this revived within her certain old fears of hers that the house was
      haunted; and that she flew up the kitchen stairs without knowing how she
      got up, to be nearer company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery thought that on reaching the hall, she saw the door of her
      liege lord’s office standing open, and the room empty. That she went to
      the ripped-up window in the little room by the street door to connect her
      palpitating heart, through the glass, with living things beyond and
      outside the haunted house. That she then saw, on the wall over the
      gateway, the shadows of the two clever ones in conversation above. That
      she then went upstairs with her shoes in her hand, partly to be near the
      clever ones as a match for most ghosts, and partly to hear what they were
      talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘None of your nonsense with me,’ said Mr Flintwinch. ‘I won’t take it from
      you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch dreamed that she stood behind the door, which was just
      ajar, and most distinctly heard her husband say these bold words.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flintwinch,’ returned Mrs Clennam, in her usual strong low voice, ‘there
      is a demon of anger in you. Guard against it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t care whether there’s one or a dozen,’ said Mr Flintwinch,
      forcibly suggesting in his tone that the higher number was nearer the
      mark. ‘If there was fifty, they should all say, None of your nonsense with
      me, I won’t take it from you—I’d make ‘em say it, whether they liked
      it or not.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What have I done, you wrathful man?’ her strong voice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Done?’ said Mr Flintwinch. ‘Dropped down upon me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you mean, remonstrated with you—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t put words into my mouth that I don’t mean,’ said Jeremiah, sticking
      to his figurative expression with tenacious and impenetrable obstinacy: ‘I
      mean dropped down upon me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I remonstrated with you,’ she began again, ‘because—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I won’t have it!’ cried Jeremiah. ‘You dropped down upon me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I dropped down upon you, then, you ill-conditioned man,’ (Jeremiah
      chuckled at having forced her to adopt his phrase,) ‘for having been
      needlessly significant to Arthur that morning. I have a right to complain
      of it as almost a breach of confidence. You did not mean it—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I won’t have it!’ interposed the contradictory Jeremiah, flinging back
      the concession. ‘I did mean it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I suppose I must leave you to speak in soliloquy if you choose,’ she
      replied, after a pause that seemed an angry one. ‘It is useless my
      addressing myself to a rash and headstrong old man who has a set purpose
      not to hear me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, I won’t take that from you either,’ said Jeremiah. ‘I have no such
      purpose. I have told you I did mean it. Do you wish to know why I meant
      it, you rash and headstrong old woman?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘After all, you only restore me my own words,’ she said, struggling with
      her indignation. ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is why, then. Because you hadn’t cleared his father to him, and you
      ought to have done it. Because, before you went into any tantrum about
      yourself, who are—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hold there, Flintwinch!’ she cried out in a changed voice: ‘you may go a
      word too far.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man seemed to think so. There was another pause, and he had
      altered his position in the room, when he spoke again more mildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was going to tell you why it was. Because, before you took your own
      part, I thought you ought to have taken the part of Arthur’s father.
      Arthur’s father! I had no particular love for Arthur’s father. I served
      Arthur’s father’s uncle, in this house, when Arthur’s father was not much
      above me—was poorer as far as his pocket went—and when his
      uncle might as soon have left me his heir as have left him. He starved in
      the parlour, and I starved in the kitchen; that was the principal
      difference in our positions; there was not much more than a flight of
      breakneck stairs between us. I never took to him in those times; I don’t
      know that I ever took to him greatly at any time. He was an undecided,
      irresolute chap, who had everything but his orphan life scared out of him
      when he was young. And when he brought you home here, the wife his uncle
      had named for him, I didn’t need to look at you twice (you were a
      good-looking woman at that time) to know who’d be master. You have stood
      of your own strength ever since. Stand of your own strength now. Don’t
      lean against the dead.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do <i>not</i>—as you call it—lean against the dead.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But you had a mind to do it, if I had submitted,’ growled Jeremiah, ‘and
      that’s why you drop down upon me. You can’t forget that I didn’t submit. I
      suppose you are astonished that I should consider it worth my while to
      have justice done to Arthur’s father? Hey? It doesn’t matter whether you
      answer or not, because I know you are, and you know you are. Come, then,
      I’ll tell you how it is. I may be a bit of an oddity in point of temper,
      but this is my temper—I can’t let anybody have entirely their own
      way. You are a determined woman, and a clever woman; and when you see your
      purpose before you, nothing will turn you from it. Who knows that better
      than I do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing will turn me from it, Flintwinch, when I have justified it to
      myself. Add that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Justified it to yourself? I said you were the most determined woman on
      the face of the earth (or I meant to say so), and if you are determined to
      justify any object you entertain, of course you’ll do it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Man! I justify myself by the authority of these Books,’ she cried, with
      stern emphasis, and appearing from the sound that followed to strike the
      dead-weight of her arm upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never mind that,’ returned Jeremiah calmly, ‘we won’t enter into that
      question at present. However that may be, you carry out your purposes, and
      you make everything go down before them. Now, I won’t go down before them.
      I have been faithful to you, and useful to you, and I am attached to you.
      But I can’t consent, and I won’t consent, and I never did consent, and I
      never will consent to be lost in you. Swallow up everybody else, and
      welcome. The peculiarity of my temper is, ma’am, that I won’t be swallowed
      up alive.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this had originally been the mainspring of the understanding
      between them. Descrying thus much of force of character in Mr Flintwinch,
      perhaps Mrs Clennam had deemed alliance with him worth her while.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Enough and more than enough of the subject,’ said she gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Unless you drop down upon me again,’ returned the persistent Flintwinch,
      ‘and then you must expect to hear of it again.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery dreamed that the figure of her lord here began walking up
      and down the room, as if to cool his spleen, and that she ran away; but
      that, as he did not issue forth when she had stood listening and trembling
      in the shadowy hall a little time, she crept up-stairs again, impelled as
      before by ghosts and curiosity, and once more cowered outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Please to light the candle, Flintwinch,’ Mrs Clennam was saying,
      apparently wishing to draw him back into their usual tone. ‘It is nearly
      time for tea. Little Dorrit is coming, and will find me in the dark.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch lighted the candle briskly, and said as he put it down upon
      the table:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What are you going to do with Little Dorrit? Is she to come to work here
      for ever? To come to tea here for ever? To come backwards and forwards
      here, in the same way, for ever?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How can you talk about “for ever” to a maimed creature like me? Are we
      not all cut down like the grass of the field, and was not I shorn by the
      scythe many years ago: since when I have been lying here, waiting to be
      gathered into the barn?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay, ay! But since you have been lying here—not near dead—nothing
      like it—numbers of children and young people, blooming women, strong
      men, and what not, have been cut down and carried; and still here are you,
      you see, not much changed after all. Your time and mine may be a long one
      yet. When I say for ever, I mean (though I am not poetical) through all
      our time.’ Mr Flintwinch gave this explanation with great calmness, and
      calmly waited for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So long as Little Dorrit is quiet and industrious, and stands in need of
      the slight help I can give her, and deserves it; so long, I suppose,
      unless she withdraws of her own act, she will continue to come here, I
      being spared.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing more than that?’ said Flintwinch, stroking his mouth and chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What should there be more than that! What could there be more than that!’ 
      she ejaculated in her sternly wondering way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, that, for the space of a minute or two, they
      remained looking at each other with the candle between them, and that she
      somehow derived an impression that they looked at each other fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you happen to know, Mrs Clennam,’ Affery’s liege lord then demanded in
      a much lower voice, and with an amount of expression that seemed quite out
      of proportion to the simple purpose of his words, ‘where she lives?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Would you—now, would you like to know?’ said Jeremiah with a pounce
      as if he had sprung upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I cared to know, I should know already. Could I not have asked her any
      day?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you don’t care to know?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do not.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, having expelled a long significant breath said, with his
      former emphasis, ‘For I have accidentally—mind!—found out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Wherever she lives,’ said Mrs Clennam, speaking in one unmodulated hard
      voice, and separating her words as distinctly as if she were reading them
      off from separate bits of metal that she took up one by one, ‘she has made
      a secret of it, and she shall always keep her secret from me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘After all, perhaps you would rather not have known the fact, any how?’ 
      said Jeremiah; and he said it with a twist, as if his words had come out
      of him in his own wry shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flintwinch,’ said his mistress and partner, flashing into a sudden energy
      that made Affery start, ‘why do you goad me? Look round this room. If it
      is any compensation for my long confinement within these narrow limits—not
      that I complain of being afflicted; you know I never complain of that—if
      it is any compensation to me for long confinement to this room, that while
      I am shut up from all pleasant change I am also shut up from the knowledge
      of some things that I may prefer to avoid knowing, why should you, of all
      men, grudge me that belief?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t grudge it to you,’ returned Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then say no more. Say no more. Let Little Dorrit keep her secret from me,
      and do you keep it from me also. Let her come and go, unobserved and
      unquestioned. Let me suffer, and let me have what alleviation belongs to
      my condition. Is it so much, that you torment me like an evil spirit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I asked you a question. That’s all.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have answered it. So, say no more. Say no more.’ Here the sound of the
      wheeled chair was heard upon the floor, and Affery’s bell rang with a
      hasty jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      More afraid of her husband at the moment than of the mysterious sound in
      the kitchen, Affery crept away as lightly and as quickly as she could,
      descended the kitchen stairs almost as rapidly as she had ascended them,
      resumed her seat before the fire, tucked up her skirt again, and finally
      threw her apron over her head. Then the bell rang once more, and then once
      more, and then kept on ringing; in despite of which importunate summons,
      Affery still sat behind her apron, recovering her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mr Flintwinch came shuffling down the staircase into the hall,
      muttering and calling ‘Affery woman!’ all the way. Affery still remaining
      behind her apron, he came stumbling down the kitchen stairs, candle in
      hand, sidled up to her, twitched her apron off, and roused her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh Jeremiah!’ cried Affery, waking. ‘What a start you gave me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What have you been doing, woman?’ inquired Jeremiah. ‘You’ve been rung
      for fifty times.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh Jeremiah,’ said Mistress Affery, ‘I have been a-dreaming!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Reminded of her former achievement in that way, Mr Flintwinch held the
      candle to her head, as if he had some idea of lighting her up for the
      illumination of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t you know it’s her tea-time?’ he demanded with a vicious grin, and
      giving one of the legs of Mistress Affery’s chair a kick.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Jeremiah? Tea-time? I don’t know what’s come to me. But I got such a
      dreadful turn, Jeremiah, before I went—off a-dreaming, that I think
      it must be that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yoogh! Sleepy-Head!’ said Mr Flintwinch, ‘what are you talking about?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Such a strange noise, Jeremiah, and such a curious movement. In the
      kitchen here—just here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah held up his light and looked at the blackened ceiling, held down
      his light and looked at the damp stone floor, turned round with his light
      and looked about at the spotted and blotched walls.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

      <a href="images/0175.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      ‘Rats, cats, water, drains,’ said Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery negatived each with a shake of her head. ‘No, Jeremiah; I
      have felt it before. I have felt it up-stairs, and once on the staircase
      as I was going from her room to ours in the night—a rustle and a
      sort of trembling touch behind me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Affery, my woman,’ said Mr Flintwinch grimly, after advancing his nose to
      that lady’s lips as a test for the detection of spirituous liquors, ‘if
      you don’t get tea pretty quick, old woman, you’ll become sensible of a
      rustle and a touch that’ll send you flying to the other end of the
      kitchen.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This prediction stimulated Mrs Flintwinch to bestir herself, and to hasten
      up-stairs to Mrs Clennam’s chamber. But, for all that, she now began to
      entertain a settled conviction that there was something wrong in the
      gloomy house. Henceforth, she was never at peace in it after daylight
      departed; and never went up or down stairs in the dark without having her
      apron over her head, lest she should see something.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with these ghostly apprehensions and her singular dreams, Mrs
      Flintwinch fell that evening into a haunted state of mind, from which it
      may be long before this present narrative descries any trace of her
      recovery. In the vagueness and indistinctness of all her new experiences
      and perceptions, as everything about her was mysterious to herself she
      began to be mysterious to others: and became as difficult to be made out
      to anybody’s satisfaction as she found the house and everything in it
      difficult to make out to her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not yet finished preparing Mrs Clennam’s tea, when the soft knock
      came to the door which always announced Little Dorrit. Mistress Affery
      looked on at Little Dorrit taking off her homely bonnet in the hall, and
      at Mr Flintwinch scraping his jaws and contemplating her in silence, as
      expecting some wonderful consequence to ensue which would frighten her out
      of her five wits or blow them all three to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      After tea there came another knock at the door, announcing Arthur.
      Mistress Affery went down to let him in, and he said on entering, ‘Affery,
      I am glad it’s you. I want to ask you a question.’ Affery immediately
      replied, ‘For goodness sake don’t ask me nothing, Arthur! I am frightened
      out of one half of my life, and dreamed out of the other. Don’t ask me
      nothing! I don’t know which is which, or what is what!’—and
      immediately started away from him, and came near him no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery having no taste for reading, and no sufficient light for
      needlework in the subdued room, supposing her to have the inclination, now
      sat every night in the dimness from which she had momentarily emerged on
      the evening of Arthur Clennam’s return, occupied with crowds of wild
      speculations and suspicions respecting her mistress and her husband and
      the noises in the house. When the ferocious devotional exercises were
      engaged in, these speculations would distract Mistress Affery’s eyes
      towards the door, as if she expected some dark form to appear at those
      propitious moments, and make the party one too many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, Affery never said or did anything to attract the attention of
      the two clever ones towards her in any marked degree, except on certain
      occasions, generally at about the quiet hour towards bed-time, when she
      would suddenly dart out of her dim corner, and whisper with a face of
      terror to Mr Flintwinch, reading the paper near Mrs Clennam’s little
      table:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, Jeremiah! Now! What’s that noise?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the noise, if there were any, would have ceased, and Mr Flintwinch
      would snarl, turning upon her as if she had cut him down that moment
      against his will, ‘Affery, old woman, you shall have a dose, old woman,
      such a dose! You have been dreaming again!’

	</hgroup>
<p>The time being come for the renewal of his acquaintance with the Meagles
      family, Clennam, pursuant to contract made between himself and Mr Meagles
      within the precincts of Bleeding Heart Yard, turned his face on a certain
      Saturday towards Twickenham, where Mr Meagles had a cottage-residence of
      his own. The weather being fine and dry, and any English road abounding in
      interest for him who had been so long away, he sent his valise on by the
      coach, and set out to walk. A walk was in itself a new enjoyment to him,
      and one that had rarely diversified his life afar off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went by Fulham and Putney, for the pleasure of strolling over the
      heath. It was bright and shining there; and when he found himself so far
      on his road to Twickenham, he found himself a long way on his road to a
      number of airier and less substantial destinations. They had risen before
      him fast, in the healthful exercise and the pleasant road. It is not easy
      to walk alone in the country without musing upon something. And he had
      plenty of unsettled subjects to meditate upon, though he had been walking
      to the Land’s End.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, there was the subject seldom absent from his mind, the question,
      what he was to do henceforth in life; to what occupation he should devote
      himself, and in what direction he had best seek it. He was far from rich,
      and every day of indecision and inaction made his inheritance a source of
      greater anxiety to him. As often as he began to consider how to increase
      this inheritance, or to lay it by, so often his misgiving that there was
      some one with an unsatisfied claim upon his justice, returned; and that
      alone was a subject to outlast the longest walk. Again, there was the
      subject of his relations with his mother, which were now upon an equable
      and peaceful but never confidential footing, and whom he saw several times
      a week. Little Dorrit was a leading and a constant subject: for the
      circumstances of his life, united to those of her own story, presented the
      little creature to him as the only person between whom and himself there
      were ties of innocent reliance on one hand, and affectionate protection on
      the other; ties of compassion, respect, unselfish interest, gratitude, and
      pity. Thinking of her, and of the possibility of her father’s release from
      prison by the unbarring hand of death—the only change of
      circumstance he could foresee that might enable him to be such a friend to
      her as he wished to be, by altering her whole manner of life, smoothing
      her rough road, and giving her a home—he regarded her, in that
      perspective, as his adopted daughter, his poor child of the Marshalsea
      hushed to rest. If there were a last subject in his thoughts, and it lay
      towards Twickenham, its form was so indefinite that it was little more
      than the pervading atmosphere in which these other subjects floated before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had crossed the heath and was leaving it behind when he gained upon a
      figure which had been in advance of him for some time, and which, as he
      gained upon it, he thought he knew. He derived this impression from
      something in the turn of the head, and in the figure’s action of
      consideration, as it went on at a sufficiently sturdy walk. But when the
      man—for it was a man’s figure—pushed his hat up at the back of
      his head, and stopped to consider some object before him, he knew it to be
      Daniel Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do you do, Mr Doyce?’ said Clennam, overtaking him. ‘I am glad to see
      you again, and in a healthier place than the Circumlocution Office.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ha! Mr Meagles’s friend!’ exclaimed that public criminal, coming out of
      some mental combinations he had been making, and offering his hand. ‘I am
      glad to see you, sir. Will you excuse me if I forget your name?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Readily. It’s not a celebrated name. It’s not Barnacle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no,’ said Daniel, laughing. ‘And now I know what it is. It’s Clennam.
      How do you do, Mr Clennam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have some hope,’ said Arthur, as they walked on together, ‘that we may
      be going to the same place, Mr Doyce.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Meaning Twickenham?’ returned Daniel. ‘I am glad to hear it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon quite intimate, and lightened the way with a variety of
      conversation. The ingenious culprit was a man of great modesty and good
      sense; and, though a plain man, had been too much accustomed to combine
      what was original and daring in conception with what was patient and
      minute in execution, to be by any means an ordinary man. It was at first
      difficult to lead him to speak about himself, and he put off Arthur’s
      advances in that direction by admitting slightly, oh yes, he had done
      this, and he had done that, and such a thing was of his making, and such
      another thing was his discovery, but it was his trade, you see, his trade;
      until, as he gradually became assured that his companion had a real
      interest in his account of himself, he frankly yielded to it. Then it
      appeared that he was the son of a north-country blacksmith, and had
      originally been apprenticed by his widowed mother to a lock-maker; that he
      had ‘struck out a few little things’ at the lock-maker’s, which had led to
      his being released from his indentures with a present, which present had
      enabled him to gratify his ardent wish to bind himself to a working
      engineer, under whom he had laboured hard, learned hard, and lived hard,
      seven years. His time being out, he had ‘worked in the shop’ at weekly
      wages seven or eight years more; and had then betaken himself to the banks
      of the Clyde, where he had studied, and filed, and hammered, and improved
      his knowledge, theoretical and practical, for six or seven years more.
      There he had had an offer to go to Lyons, which he had accepted; and from
      Lyons had been engaged to go to Germany, and in Germany had had an offer
      to go to St Petersburg, and there had done very well indeed—never
      better. However, he had naturally felt a preference for his own country,
      and a wish to gain distinction there, and to do whatever service he could
      do, there rather than elsewhere. And so he had come home. And so at home
      he had established himself in business, and had invented and executed, and
      worked his way on, until, after a dozen years of constant suit and
      service, he had been enrolled in the Great British Legion of Honour, the
      Legion of the Rebuffed of the Circumlocution Office, and had been
      decorated with the Great British Order of Merit, the Order of the Disorder
      of the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is much to be regretted,’ said Clennam, ‘that you ever turned your
      thoughts that way, Mr Doyce.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True, sir, true to a certain extent. But what is a man to do? if he has
      the misfortune to strike out something serviceable to the nation, he must
      follow where it leads him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hadn’t he better let it go?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He can’t do it,’ said Doyce, shaking his head with a thoughtful smile.
      ‘It’s not put into his head to be buried. It’s put into his head to be
      made useful. You hold your life on the condition that to the last you
      shall struggle hard for it. Every man holds a discovery on the same
      terms.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That is to say,’ said Arthur, with a growing admiration of his quiet
      companion, ‘you are not finally discouraged even now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have no right to be, if I am,’ returned the other. ‘The thing is as
      true as it ever was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had walked a little way in silence, Clennam, at once to change
      the direct point of their conversation and not to change it too abruptly,
      asked Mr Doyce if he had any partner in his business to relieve him of a
      portion of its anxieties?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ he returned, ‘not at present. I had when I first entered on it, and
      a good man he was. But he has been dead some years; and as I could not
      easily take to the notion of another when I lost him, I bought his share
      for myself and have gone on by myself ever since. And here’s another
      thing,’ he said, stopping for a moment with a good-humoured laugh in his
      eyes, and laying his closed right hand, with its peculiar suppleness of
      thumb, on Clennam’s arm, ‘no inventor can be a man of business, you know.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, so the men of business say,’ he answered, resuming the walk and
      laughing outright. ‘I don’t know why we unfortunate creatures should be
      supposed to want common sense, but it is generally taken for granted that
      we do. Even the best friend I have in the world, our excellent friend over
      yonder,’ said Doyce, nodding towards Twickenham, ‘extends a sort of
      protection to me, don’t you know, as a man not quite able to take care of
      himself?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam could not help joining in the good-humoured laugh, for he
      recognised the truth of the description.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So I find that I must have a partner who is a man of business and not
      guilty of any inventions,’ said Daniel Doyce, taking off his hat to pass
      his hand over his forehead, ‘if it’s only in deference to the current
      opinion, and to uphold the credit of the Works. I don’t think he’ll find
      that I have been very remiss or confused in my way of conducting them; but
      that’s for him to say—whoever he is—not for me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have not chosen him yet, then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, no. I have only just come to a decision to take one. The fact
      is, there’s more to do than there used to be, and the Works are enough for
      me as I grow older. What with the books and correspondence, and foreign
      journeys for which a Principal is necessary, I can’t do all. I am going to
      talk over the best way of negotiating the matter, if I find a spare
      half-hour between this and Monday morning, with my—my Nurse and
      protector,’ said Doyce, with laughing eyes again. ‘He is a sagacious man
      in business, and has had a good apprenticeship to it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, they conversed on different subjects until they arrived at
      their journey’s end. A composed and unobtrusive self-sustainment was
      noticeable in Daniel Doyce—a calm knowledge that what was true must
      remain true, in spite of all the Barnacles in the family ocean, and would
      be just the truth, and neither more nor less when even that sea had run
      dry—which had a kind of greatness in it, though not of the official
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he knew the house well, he conducted Arthur to it by the way that
      showed it to the best advantage. It was a charming place (none the worse
      for being a little eccentric), on the road by the river, and just what the
      residence of the Meagles family ought to be. It stood in a garden, no
      doubt as fresh and beautiful in the May of the Year as Pet now was in the
      May of her life; and it was defended by a goodly show of handsome trees
      and spreading evergreens, as Pet was by Mr and Mrs Meagles. It was made
      out of an old brick house, of which a part had been altogether pulled
      down, and another part had been changed into the present cottage; so there
      was a hale elderly portion, to represent Mr and Mrs Meagles, and a young
      picturesque, very pretty portion to represent Pet. There was even the
      later addition of a conservatory sheltering itself against it, uncertain
      of hue in its deep-stained glass, and in its more transparent portions
      flashing to the sun’s rays, now like fire and now like harmless water
      drops; which might have stood for Tattycoram. Within view was the peaceful
      river and the ferry-boat, to moralise to all the inmates saying: Young or
      old, passionate or tranquil, chafing or content, you, thus runs the
      current always. Let the heart swell into what discord it will, thus plays
      the rippling water on the prow of the ferry-boat ever the same tune. Year
      after year, so much allowance for the drifting of the boat, so many miles
      an hour the flowing of the stream, here the rushes, there the lilies,
      nothing uncertain or unquiet, upon this road that steadily runs away;
      while you, upon your flowing road of time, are so capricious and
      distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell at the gate had scarcely sounded when Mr Meagles came out to
      receive them. Mr Meagles had scarcely come out, when Mrs Meagles came out.
      Mrs Meagles had scarcely come out, when Pet came out. Pet scarcely had
      come out, when Tattycoram came out. Never had visitors a more hospitable
      reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here we are, you see,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘boxed up, Mr Clennam, within our
      own home-limits, as if we were never going to expand—that is, travel—again.
      Not like Marseilles, eh? No allonging and marshonging here!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A different kind of beauty, indeed!’ said Clennam, looking about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, Lord bless me!’ cried Mr Meagles, rubbing his hands with a relish,
      ‘it was an uncommonly pleasant thing being in quarantine, wasn’t it? Do
      you know, I have often wished myself back again? We were a capital party.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Mr Meagles’s invariable habit. Always to object to everything
      while he was travelling, and always to want to get back to it when he was
      not travelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If it was summer-time,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘which I wish it was on your
      account, and in order that you might see the place at its best, you would
      hardly be able to hear yourself speak for birds. Being practical people,
      we never allow anybody to scare the birds; and the birds, being practical
      people too, come about us in myriads. We are delighted to see you, Clennam
      (if you’ll allow me, I shall drop the Mister); I heartily assure you, we
      are delighted.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have not had so pleasant a greeting,’ said Clennam—then he
      recalled what Little Dorrit had said to him in his own room, and
      faithfully added ‘except once—since we last walked to and fro,
      looking down at the Mediterranean.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah!’ returned Mr Meagles. ‘Something like a look out, <i>that</i> was,
      wasn’t it? I don’t want a military government, but I shouldn’t mind a
      little allonging and marshonging—just a dash of it—in this
      neighbourhood sometimes. It’s Devilish still.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bestowing this eulogium on the retired character of his retreat with a
      dubious shake of the head, Mr Meagles led the way into the house. It was
      just large enough, and no more; was as pretty within as it was without,
      and was perfectly well-arranged and comfortable. Some traces of the
      migratory habits of the family were to be observed in the covered frames
      and furniture, and wrapped-up hangings; but it was easy to see that it was
      one of Mr Meagles’s whims to have the cottage always kept, in their
      absence, as if they were always coming back the day after to-morrow. Of
      articles collected on his various expeditions, there was such a vast
      miscellany that it was like the dwelling of an amiable Corsair. There were
      antiquities from Central Italy, made by the best modern houses in that
      department of industry; bits of mummy from Egypt (and perhaps Birmingham);
      model gondolas from Venice; model villages from Switzerland; morsels of
      tesselated pavement from Herculaneum and Pompeii, like petrified minced
      veal; ashes out of tombs, and lava out of Vesuvius; Spanish fans, Spezzian
      straw hats, Moorish slippers, Tuscan hairpins, Carrara sculpture,
      Trastaverini scarves, Genoese velvets and filigree, Neapolitan coral,
      Roman cameos, Geneva jewellery, Arab lanterns, rosaries blest all round by
      the Pope himself, and an infinite variety of lumber. There were views,
      like and unlike, of a multitude of places; and there was one little
      picture-room devoted to a few of the regular sticky old Saints, with
      sinews like whipcord, hair like Neptune’s, wrinkles like tattooing, and
      such coats of varnish that every holy personage served for a fly-trap, and
      became what is now called in the vulgar tongue a Catch-em-alive O. Of
      these pictorial acquisitions Mr Meagles spoke in the usual manner. He was
      no judge, he said, except of what pleased himself; he had picked them up,
      dirt-cheap, and people <i>had</i> considered them rather fine. One man,
      who at any rate ought to know something of the subject, had declared that
      ‘Sage, Reading’ (a specially oily old gentleman in a blanket, with a
      swan’s-down tippet for a beard, and a web of cracks all over him like rich
      pie-crust), to be a fine Guercino. As for Sebastian del Piombo there, you
      would judge for yourself; if it were not his later manner, the question
      was, Who was it? Titian, that might or might not be—perhaps he had
      only touched it. Daniel Doyce said perhaps he hadn’t touched it, but Mr
      Meagles rather declined to overhear the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had shown all his spoils, Mr Meagles took them into his own snug
      room overlooking the lawn, which was fitted up in part like a
      dressing-room and in part like an office, and in which, upon a kind of
      counter-desk, were a pair of brass scales for weighing gold, and a scoop
      for shovelling out money.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here they are, you see,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘I stood behind these two
      articles five-and-thirty years running, when I no more thought of gadding
      about than I now think of—staying at home. When I left the Bank for
      good, I asked for them, and brought them away with me. I mention it at
      once, or you might suppose that I sit in my counting-house (as Pet says I
      do), like the king in the poem of the four-and-twenty blackbirds, counting
      out my money.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam’s eyes had strayed to a natural picture on the wall, of two pretty
      little girls with their arms entwined. ‘Yes, Clennam,’ said Mr Meagles, in
      a lower voice. ‘There they both are. It was taken some seventeen years
      ago. As I often say to Mother, they were babies then.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Their names?’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, to be sure! You have never heard any name but Pet. Pet’s name is
      Minnie; her sister’s Lillie.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Should you have known, Mr Clennam, that one of them was meant for me?’ 
      asked Pet herself, now standing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I might have thought that both of them were meant for you, both are still
      so like you. Indeed,’ said Clennam, glancing from the fair original to the
      picture and back, ‘I cannot even now say which is not your portrait.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘D’ye hear that, Mother?’ cried Mr Meagles to his wife, who had followed
      her daughter. ‘It’s always the same, Clennam; nobody can decide. The child
      to your left is Pet.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture happened to be near a looking-glass. As Arthur looked at it
      again, he saw, by the reflection of the mirror, Tattycoram stop in passing
      outside the door, listen to what was going on, and pass away with an angry
      and contemptuous frown upon her face, that changed its beauty into
      ugliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But come!’ said Mr Meagles. ‘You have had a long walk, and will be glad
      to get your boots off. As to Daniel here, I suppose he’d never think of
      taking <i>his</i> boots off, unless we showed him a boot-jack.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not?’ asked Daniel, with a significant smile at Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! You have so many things to think about,’ returned Mr Meagles,
      clapping him on the shoulder, as if his weakness must not be left to
      itself on any account. ‘Figures, and wheels, and cogs, and levers, and
      screws, and cylinders, and a thousand things.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In my calling,’ said Daniel, amused, ‘the greater usually includes the
      less. But never mind, never mind! Whatever pleases you, pleases me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam could not help speculating, as he seated himself in his room by
      the fire, whether there might be in the breast of this honest,
      affectionate, and cordial Mr Meagles, any microscopic portion of the
      mustard-seed that had sprung up into the great tree of the Circumlocution
      Office. His curious sense of a general superiority to Daniel Doyce, which
      seemed to be founded, not so much on anything in Doyce’s personal
      character as on the mere fact of his being an originator and a man out of
      the beaten track of other men, suggested the idea. It might have occupied
      him until he went down to dinner an hour afterwards, if he had not had
      another question to consider, which had been in his mind so long ago as
      before he was in quarantine at Marseilles, and which had now returned to
      it, and was very urgent with it. No less a question than this: Whether he
      should allow himself to fall in love with Pet?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was twice her age. (He changed the leg he had crossed over the other,
      and tried the calculation again, but could not bring out the total at
      less.) He was twice her age. Well! He was young in appearance, young in
      health and strength, young in heart. A man was certainly not old at forty;
      and many men were not in circumstances to marry, or did not marry, until
      they had attained that time of life. On the other hand, the question was,
      not what he thought of the point, but what she thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed that Mr Meagles was disposed to entertain a ripe regard for
      him, and he knew that he had a sincere regard for Mr Meagles and his good
      wife. He could foresee that to relinquish this beautiful only child, of
      whom they were so fond, to any husband, would be a trial of their love
      which perhaps they never yet had had the fortitude to contemplate. But the
      more beautiful and winning and charming she, the nearer they must always
      be to the necessity of approaching it. And why not in his favour, as well
      as in another’s?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had got so far, it came again into his head that the question was,
      not what they thought of it, but what she thought of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam was a retiring man, with a sense of many deficiencies; and
      he so exalted the merits of the beautiful Minnie in his mind, and
      depressed his own, that when he pinned himself to this point, his hopes
      began to fail him. He came to the final resolution, as he made himself
      ready for dinner, that he would not allow himself to fall in love with
      Pet.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only five, at a round table, and it was very pleasant indeed.
      They had so many places and people to recall, and they were all so easy
      and cheerful together (Daniel Doyce either sitting out like an amused
      spectator at cards, or coming in with some shrewd little experiences of
      his own, when it happened to be to the purpose), that they might have been
      together twenty times, and not have known so much of one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And Miss Wade,’ said Mr Meagles, after they had recalled a number of
      fellow-travellers. ‘Has anybody seen Miss Wade?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have,’ said Tattycoram.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had brought a little mantle which her young mistress had sent for, and
      was bending over her, putting it on, when she lifted up her dark eyes and
      made this unexpected answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tatty!’ her young mistress exclaimed. ‘You seen Miss Wade?—where?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here, miss,’ said Tattycoram.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      An impatient glance from Tattycoram seemed, as Clennam saw it, to answer
      ‘With my eyes!’ But her only answer in words was: ‘I met her near the
      church.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What was she doing there I wonder!’ said Mr Meagles. ‘Not going to it, I
      should think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She had written to me first,’ said Tattycoram.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Tatty!’ murmured her mistress, ‘take your hands away. I feel as if
      some one else was touching me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it in a quick involuntary way, but half playfully, and not more
      petulantly or disagreeably than a favourite child might have done, who
      laughed next moment. Tattycoram set her full red lips together, and
      crossed her arms upon her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did you wish to know, sir,’ she said, looking at Mr Meagles, ‘what Miss
      Wade wrote to me about?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Tattycoram,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘since you ask the question, and
      we are all friends here, perhaps you may as well mention it, if you are so
      inclined.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She knew, when we were travelling, where you lived,’ said Tattycoram,
      ‘and she had seen me not quite—not quite—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not quite in a good temper, Tattycoram?’ suggested Mr Meagles, shaking
      his head at the dark eyes with a quiet caution. ‘Take a little time—count
      five-and-twenty, Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her lips together again, and took a long deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So she wrote to me to say that if I ever felt myself hurt,’ she looked
      down at her young mistress, ‘or found myself worried,’ she looked down at
      her again, ‘I might go to her, and be considerately treated. I was to
      think of it, and could speak to her by the church. So I went there to
      thank her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tatty,’ said her young mistress, putting her hand up over her shoulder
      that the other might take it, ‘Miss Wade almost frightened me when we
      parted, and I scarcely like to think of her just now as having been so
      near me without my knowing it. Tatty dear!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tatty stood for a moment, immovable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hey?’ cried Mr Meagles. ‘Count another five-and-twenty, Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She might have counted a dozen, when she bent and put her lips to the
      caressing hand. It patted her cheek, as it touched the owner’s beautiful
      curls, and Tattycoram went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now there,’ said Mr Meagles softly, as he gave a turn to the dumb-waiter
      on his right hand to twirl the sugar towards himself. ‘There’s a girl who
      might be lost and ruined, if she wasn’t among practical people. Mother and
      I know, solely from being practical, that there are times when that girl’s
      whole nature seems to roughen itself against seeing us so bound up in Pet.
      No father and mother were bound up in her, poor soul. I don’t like to
      think of the way in which that unfortunate child, with all that passion
      and protest in her, feels when she hears the Fifth Commandment on a
      Sunday. I am always inclined to call out, Church, Count five-and-twenty,
      Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides his dumb-waiter, Mr Meagles had two other not dumb waiters in the
      persons of two parlour-maids with rosy faces and bright eyes, who were a
      highly ornamental part of the table decoration. ‘And why not, you see?’ 
      said Mr Meagles on this head. ‘As I always say to Mother, why not have
      something pretty to look at, if you have anything at all?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain Mrs Tickit, who was Cook and Housekeeper when the family were at
      home, and Housekeeper only when the family were away, completed the
      establishment. Mr Meagles regretted that the nature of the duties in which
      she was engaged, rendered Mrs Tickit unpresentable at present, but hoped
      to introduce her to the new visitor to-morrow. She was an important part
      of the Cottage, he said, and all his friends knew her. That was her
      picture up in the corner. When they went away, she always put on the
      silk-gown and the jet-black row of curls represented in that portrait (her
      hair was reddish-grey in the kitchen), established herself in the
      breakfast-room, put her spectacles between two particular leaves of Doctor
      Buchan’s Domestic Medicine, and sat looking over the blind all day until
      they came back again. It was supposed that no persuasion could be invented
      which would induce Mrs Tickit to abandon her post at the blind, however
      long their absence, or to dispense with the attendance of Dr Buchan; the
      lucubrations of which learned practitioner, Mr Meagles implicitly believed
      she had never yet consulted to the extent of one word in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening they played an old-fashioned rubber; and Pet sat looking
      over her father’s hand, or singing to herself by fits and starts at the
      piano. She was a spoilt child; but how could she be otherwise? Who could
      be much with so pliable and beautiful a creature, and not yield to her
      endearing influence? Who could pass an evening in the house, and not love
      her for the grace and charm of her very presence in the room? This was
      Clennam’s reflection, notwithstanding the final conclusion at which he had
      arrived up-stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making it, he revoked. ‘Why, what are you thinking of, my good sir?’ 
      asked the astonished Mr Meagles, who was his partner. ‘I beg your pardon.
      Nothing,’ returned Clennam. ‘Think of something, next time; that’s a dear
      fellow,’ said Mr Meagles. Pet laughingly believed he had been thinking of
      Miss Wade. ‘Why of Miss Wade, Pet?’ asked her father. ‘Why, indeed!’ said
      Arthur Clennam. Pet coloured a little, and went to the piano again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they broke up for the night, Arthur overheard Doyce ask his host if he
      could give him half an hour’s conversation before breakfast in the
      morning? The host replying willingly, Arthur lingered behind a moment,
      having his own word to add to that topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Meagles,’ he said, on their being left alone, ‘do you remember when
      you advised me to go straight to London?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perfectly well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And when you gave me some other good advice which I needed at that time?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I won’t say what it was worth,’ answered Mr Meagles: ‘but of course I
      remember our being very pleasant and confidential together.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have acted on your advice; and having disembarrassed myself of an
      occupation that was painful to me for many reasons, wish to devote myself
      and what means I have, to another pursuit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Right! You can’t do it too soon,’ said Mr Meagles.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, as I came down to-day, I found that your friend, Mr Doyce, is
      looking for a partner in his business—not a partner in his
      mechanical knowledge, but in the ways and means of turning the business
      arising from it to the best account.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just so,’ said Mr Meagles, with his hands in his pockets, and with the
      old business expression of face that had belonged to the scales and scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Doyce mentioned incidentally, in the course of our conversation, that
      he was going to take your valuable advice on the subject of finding such a
      partner. If you should think our views and opportunities at all likely to
      coincide, perhaps you will let him know my available position. I speak, of
      course, in ignorance of the details, and they may be unsuitable on both
      sides.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt, no doubt,’ said Mr Meagles, with the caution belonging to the
      scales and scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But they will be a question of figures and accounts—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just so, just so,’ said Mr Meagles, with arithmetical solidity belonging
      to the scales and scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—And I shall be glad to enter into the subject, provided Mr Doyce
      responds, and you think well of it. If you will at present, therefore,
      allow me to place it in your hands, you will much oblige me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Clennam, I accept the trust with readiness,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘And
      without anticipating any of the points which you, as a man of business,
      have of course reserved, I am free to say to you that I think something
      may come of this. Of one thing you may be perfectly certain. Daniel is an
      honest man.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am so sure of it that I have promptly made up my mind to speak to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must guide him, you know; you must steer him; you must direct him; he
      is one of a crotchety sort,’ said Mr Meagles, evidently meaning nothing
      more than that he did new things and went new ways; ‘but he is as honest
      as the sun, and so good night!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam went back to his room, sat down again before his fire, and made up
      his mind that he was glad he had resolved not to fall in love with Pet.
      She was so beautiful, so amiable, so apt to receive any true impression
      given to her gentle nature and her innocent heart, and make the man who
      should be so happy as to communicate it, the most fortunate and enviable
      of all men, that he was very glad indeed he had come to that conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as this might have been a reason for coming to the opposite
      conclusion, he followed out the theme again a little way in his mind; to
      justify himself, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Suppose that a man,’ so his thoughts ran, ‘who had been of age some
      twenty years or so; who was a diffident man, from the circumstances of his
      youth; who was rather a grave man, from the tenor of his life; who knew
      himself to be deficient in many little engaging qualities which he admired
      in others, from having been long in a distant region, with nothing
      softening near him; who had no kind sisters to present to her; who had no
      congenial home to make her known in; who was a stranger in the land; who
      had not a fortune to compensate, in any measure, for these defects; who
      had nothing in his favour but his honest love and his general wish to do
      right—suppose such a man were to come to this house, and were to
      yield to the captivation of this charming girl, and were to persuade
      himself that he could hope to win her; what a weakness it would be!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He softly opened his window, and looked out upon the serene river. Year
      after year so much allowance for the drifting of the ferry-boat, so many
      miles an hour the flowing of the stream, here the rushes, there the
      lilies, nothing uncertain or unquiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should he be vexed or sore at heart? It was not his weakness that he
      had imagined. It was nobody’s, nobody’s within his knowledge; why should
      it trouble him? And yet it did trouble him. And he thought—who has
      not thought for a moment, sometimes?—that it might be better to flow
      away monotonously, like the river, and to compound for its insensibility
      to happiness with its insensibility to pain.

<p>Before breakfast in the morning, Arthur walked out to look about him. As
      the morning was fine and he had an hour on his hands, he crossed the river
      by the ferry, and strolled along a footpath through some meadows. When he
      came back to the towing-path, he found the ferry-boat on the opposite
      side, and a gentleman hailing it and waiting to be taken over.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0189.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This gentleman looked barely thirty. He was well dressed, of a sprightly
      and gay appearance, a well-knit figure, and a rich dark complexion. As
      Arthur came over the stile and down to the water’s edge, the lounger
      glanced at him for a moment, and then resumed his occupation of idly
      tossing stones into the water with his foot. There was something in his
      way of spurning them out of their places with his heel, and getting them
      into the required position, that Clennam thought had an air of cruelty in
      it. Most of us have more or less frequently derived a similar impression
      from a man’s manner of doing some very little thing: plucking a flower,
      clearing away an obstacle, or even destroying an insentient object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman’s thoughts were preoccupied, as his face showed, and he took
      no notice of a fine Newfoundland dog, who watched him attentively, and
      watched every stone too, in its turn, eager to spring into the river on
      receiving his master’s sign. The ferry-boat came over, however, without
      his receiving any sign, and when it grounded his master took him by the
      collar and walked him into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not this morning,’ he said to the dog. ‘You won’t do for ladies’ company,
      dripping wet. Lie down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam followed the man and the dog into the boat, and took his seat. The
      dog did as he was ordered. The man remained standing, with his hands in
      his pockets, and towered between Clennam and the prospect. Man and dog
      both jumped lightly out as soon as they touched the other side, and went
      away. Clennam was glad to be rid of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church clock struck the breakfast hour as he walked up the little lane
      by which the garden-gate was approached. The moment he pulled the bell a
      deep loud barking assailed him from within the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I heard no dog last night,’ thought Clennam. The gate was opened by one
      of the rosy maids, and on the lawn were the Newfoundland dog and the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Minnie is not down yet, gentlemen,’ said the blushing portress, as
      they all came together in the garden. Then she said to the master of the
      dog, ‘Mr Clennam, sir,’ and tripped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Odd enough, Mr Clennam, that we should have met just now,’ said the man.
      Upon which the dog became mute. ‘Allow me to introduce myself—Henry
      Gowan. A pretty place this, and looks wonderfully well this morning!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The manner was easy, and the voice agreeable; but still Clennam thought,
      that if he had not made that decided resolution to avoid falling in love
      with Pet, he would have taken a dislike to this Henry Gowan.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s new to you, I believe?’ said this Gowan, when Arthur had extolled
      the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite new. I made acquaintance with it only yesterday afternoon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! Of course this is not its best aspect. It used to look charming in
      the spring, before they went away last time. I should like you to have
      seen it then.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that resolution so often recalled, Clennam might have wished him
      in the crater of Mount Etna, in return for this civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have had the pleasure of seeing it under many circumstances during the
      last three years, and it’s—a Paradise.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was (at least it might have been, always excepting for that wise
      resolution) like his dexterous impudence to call it a Paradise. He only
      called it a Paradise because he first saw her coming, and so made her out
      within her hearing to be an angel, Confusion to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      And ah! how beaming she looked, and how glad! How she caressed the dog,
      and how the dog knew her! How expressive that heightened colour in her
      face, that fluttered manner, her downcast eyes, her irresolute happiness!
      When had Clennam seen her look like this? Not that there was any reason
      why he might, could, would, or should have ever seen her look like this,
      or that he had ever hoped for himself to see her look like this; but still—when
      had he ever known her do it!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at a little distance from them. This Gowan when he had talked
      about a Paradise, had gone up to her and taken her hand. The dog had put
      his great paws on her arm and laid his head against her dear bosom. She
      had laughed and welcomed them, and made far too much of the dog, far, far,
      too much—that is to say, supposing there had been any third person
      looking on who loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She disengaged herself now, and came to Clennam, and put her hand in his
      and wished him good morning, and gracefully made as if she would take his
      arm and be escorted into the house. To this Gowan had no objection. No, he
      knew he was too safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a passing cloud on Mr Meagles’s good-humoured face when they all
      three (four, counting the dog, and he was the most objectionable but one
      of the party) came in to breakfast. Neither it, nor the touch of
      uneasiness on Mrs Meagles as she directed her eyes towards it, was
      unobserved by Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Gowan,’ said Mr Meagles, even suppressing a sigh; ‘how goes the
      world with you this morning?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Much as usual, sir. Lion and I being determined not to waste anything of
      our weekly visit, turned out early, and came over from Kingston, my
      present headquarters, where I am making a sketch or two.’ Then he told how
      he had met Mr Clennam at the ferry, and they had come over together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Gowan is well, Henry?’ said Mrs Meagles. (Clennam became attentive.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My mother is quite well, thank you.’ (Clennam became inattentive.) ‘I
      have taken the liberty of making an addition to your family dinner-party
      to-day, which I hope will not be inconvenient to you or to Mr Meagles. I
      couldn’t very well get out of it,’ he explained, turning to the latter.
      ‘The young fellow wrote to propose himself to me; and as he is well
      connected, I thought you would not object to my transferring him here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who <i>is</i> the young fellow?’ asked Mr Meagles with peculiar
      complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He is one of the Barnacles. Tite Barnacle’s son, Clarence Barnacle, who
      is in his father’s Department. I can at least guarantee that the river
      shall not suffer from his visit. He won’t set it on fire.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Aye, aye?’ said Meagles. ‘A Barnacle is he? <i>We</i> know something of
      that family, eh, Dan? By George, they are at the top of the tree, though!
      Let me see. What relation will this young fellow be to Lord Decimus now?
      His Lordship married, in seventeen ninety-seven, Lady Jemima Bilberry, who
      was the second daughter by the third marriage—no! There I am wrong!
      That was Lady Seraphina—Lady Jemima was the first daughter by the
      second marriage of the fifteenth Earl of Stiltstalking with the Honourable
      Clementina Toozellem. Very well. Now this young fellow’s father married a
      Stiltstalking and <i>his</i> father married his cousin who was a Barnacle.
      The father of that father who married a Barnacle, married a Joddleby.—I
      am getting a little too far back, Gowan; I want to make out what relation
      this young fellow is to Lord Decimus.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s easily stated. His father is nephew to Lord Decimus.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nephew—to—Lord—Decimus,’ Mr Meagles luxuriously
      repeated with his eyes shut, that he might have nothing to distract him
      from the full flavour of the genealogical tree. ‘By George, you are right,
      Gowan. So he is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Consequently, Lord Decimus is his great uncle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But stop a bit!’ said Mr Meagles, opening his eyes with a fresh
      discovery. ‘Then on the mother’s side, Lady Stiltstalking is his great
      aunt.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course she is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Aye, aye, aye?’ said Mr Meagles with much interest. ‘Indeed, indeed? We
      shall be glad to see him. We’ll entertain him as well as we can, in our
      humble way; and we shall not starve him, I hope, at all events.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of this dialogue, Clennam had expected some great
      harmless outburst from Mr Meagles, like that which had made him burst out
      of the Circumlocution Office, holding Doyce by the collar. But his good
      friend had a weakness which none of us need go into the next street to
      find, and which no amount of Circumlocution experience could long subdue
      in him. Clennam looked at Doyce; but Doyce knew all about it beforehand,
      and looked at his plate, and made no sign, and said no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am much obliged to you,’ said Gowan, to conclude the subject. ‘Clarence
      is a great ass, but he is one of the dearest and best fellows that ever
      lived!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, before the breakfast was over, that everybody whom this Gowan
      knew was either more or less of an ass, or more or less of a knave; but
      was, notwithstanding, the most lovable, the most engaging, the simplest,
      truest, kindest, dearest, best fellow that ever lived. The process by
      which this unvarying result was attained, whatever the premises, might
      have been stated by Mr Henry Gowan thus: ‘I claim to be always
      book-keeping, with a peculiar nicety, in every man’s case, and posting up
      a careful little account of Good and Evil with him. I do this so
      conscientiously, that I am happy to tell you I find the most worthless of
      men to be the dearest old fellow too: and am in a condition to make the
      gratifying report, that there is much less difference than you are
      inclined to suppose between an honest man and a scoundrel.’ The effect of
      this cheering discovery happened to be, that while he seemed to be
      scrupulously finding good in most men, he did in reality lower it where it
      was, and set it up where it was not; but that was its only disagreeable or
      dangerous feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It scarcely seemed, however, to afford Mr Meagles as much satisfaction as
      the Barnacle genealogy had done. The cloud that Clennam had never seen
      upon his face before that morning, frequently overcast it again; and there
      was the same shadow of uneasy observation of him on the comely face of his
      wife. More than once or twice when Pet caressed the dog, it appeared to
      Clennam that her father was unhappy in seeing her do it; and, in one
      particular instance when Gowan stood on the other side of the dog, and
      bent his head at the same time, Arthur fancied that he saw tears rise to
      Mr Meagles’s eyes as he hurried out of the room. It was either the fact
      too, or he fancied further, that Pet herself was not insensible to these
      little incidents; that she tried, with a more delicate affection than
      usual, to express to her good father how much she loved him; that it was
      on this account that she fell behind the rest, both as they went to church
      and as they returned from it, and took his arm. He could not have sworn
      but that as he walked alone in the garden afterwards, he had an
      instantaneous glimpse of her in her father’s room, clinging to both her
      parents with the greatest tenderness, and weeping on her father’s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of the day turning out wet, they were fain to keep the
      house, look over Mr Meagles’s collection, and beguile the time with
      conversation. This Gowan had plenty to say for himself, and said it in an
      off-hand and amusing manner. He appeared to be an artist by profession,
      and to have been at Rome some time; yet he had a slight, careless, amateur
      way with him—a perceptible limp, both in his devotion to art and his
      attainments—which Clennam could scarcely understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He applied to Daniel Doyce for help, as they stood together, looking out
      of window.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You know Mr Gowan?’ he said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have seen him here. Comes here every Sunday when they are at home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An artist, I infer from what he says?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A sort of a one,’ said Daniel Doyce, in a surly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What sort of a one?’ asked Clennam, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, he has sauntered into the Arts at a leisurely Pall-Mall pace,’ said
      Doyce, ‘and I doubt if they care to be taken quite so coolly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursuing his inquiries, Clennam found that the Gowan family were a very
      distant ramification of the Barnacles; and that the paternal Gowan,
      originally attached to a legation abroad, had been pensioned off as a
      Commissioner of nothing particular somewhere or other, and had died at his
      post with his drawn salary in his hand, nobly defending it to the last
      extremity. In consideration of this eminent public service, the Barnacle
      then in power had recommended the Crown to bestow a pension of two or
      three hundred a-year on his widow; to which the next Barnacle in power had
      added certain shady and sedate apartments in the Palaces at Hampton Court,
      where the old lady still lived, deploring the degeneracy of the times in
      company with several other old ladies of both sexes. Her son, Mr Henry
      Gowan, inheriting from his father, the Commissioner, that very
      questionable help in life, a very small independence, had been difficult
      to settle; the rather, as public appointments chanced to be scarce, and
      his genius, during his earlier manhood, was of that exclusively
      agricultural character which applies itself to the cultivation of wild
      oats. At last he had declared that he would become a Painter; partly
      because he had always had an idle knack that way, and partly to grieve the
      souls of the Barnacles-in-chief who had not provided for him. So it had
      come to pass successively, first, that several distinguished ladies had
      been frightfully shocked; then, that portfolios of his performances had
      been handed about o’ nights, and declared with ecstasy to be perfect
      Claudes, perfect Cuyps, perfect phaenomena; then, that Lord Decimus had
      bought his picture, and had asked the President and Council to dinner at a
      blow, and had said, with his own magnificent gravity, ‘Do you know, there
      appears to me to be really immense merit in that work?’ and, in short,
      that people of condition had absolutely taken pains to bring him into
      fashion. But, somehow, it had all failed. The prejudiced public had stood
      out against it obstinately. They had determined not to admire Lord
      Decimus’s picture. They had determined to believe that in every service,
      except their own, a man must qualify himself, by striving early and late,
      and by working heart and soul, might and main. So now Mr Gowan, like that
      worn-out old coffin which never was Mahomet’s nor anybody else’s, hung
      midway between two points: jaundiced and jealous as to the one he had
      left: jaundiced and jealous as to the other that he couldn’t reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the substance of Clennam’s discoveries concerning him, made that
      rainy Sunday afternoon and afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      About an hour or so after dinner time, Young Barnacle appeared, attended
      by his eye-glass; in honour of whose family connections, Mr Meagles had
      cashiered the pretty parlour-maids for the day, and had placed on duty in
      their stead two dingy men. Young Barnacle was in the last degree amazed
      and disconcerted at sight of Arthur, and had murmured involuntarily, ‘Look
      here! upon my soul, you know!’ before his presence of mind returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then, he was obliged to embrace the earliest opportunity of taking
      his friend into a window, and saying, in a nasal way that was a part of
      his general debility:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I want to speak to you, Gowan. I say. Look here. Who is that fellow?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A friend of our host’s. None of mine.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He’s a most ferocious Radical, you know,’ said Young Barnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is he? How do you know?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ecod, sir, he was Pitching into our people the other day in the most
      tremendous manner. Went up to our place and Pitched into my father to that
      extent that it was necessary to order him out. Came back to our
      Department, and Pitched into me. Look here. You never saw such a fellow.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What did he want?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ecod, sir,’ returned Young Barnacle, ‘he said he wanted to know, you
      know! Pervaded our Department—without an appointment—and said
      he wanted to know!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stare of indignant wonder with which Young Barnacle accompanied this
      disclosure, would have strained his eyes injuriously but for the opportune
      relief of dinner. Mr Meagles (who had been extremely solicitous to know
      how his uncle and aunt were) begged him to conduct Mrs Meagles to the
      dining-room. And when he sat on Mrs Meagles’s right hand, Mr Meagles
      looked as gratified as if his whole family were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the natural charm of the previous day was gone. The eaters of the
      dinner, like the dinner itself, were lukewarm, insipid, overdone—and
      all owing to this poor little dull Young Barnacle. Conversationless at any
      time, he was now the victim of a weakness special to the occasion, and
      solely referable to Clennam. He was under a pressing and continual
      necessity of looking at that gentleman, which occasioned his eye-glass to
      get into his soup, into his wine-glass, into Mrs Meagles’s plate, to hang
      down his back like a bell-rope, and be several times disgracefully
      restored to his bosom by one of the dingy men. Weakened in mind by his
      frequent losses of this instrument, and its determination not to stick in
      his eye, and more and more enfeebled in intellect every time he looked at
      the mysterious Clennam, he applied spoons to his eyes, forks, and other
      foreign matters connected with the furniture of the dinner-table. His
      discovery of these mistakes greatly increased his difficulties, but never
      released him from the necessity of looking at Clennam. And whenever
      Clennam spoke, this ill-starred young man was clearly seized with a dread
      that he was coming, by some artful device, round to that point of wanting
      to know, you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be questioned, therefore, whether any one but Mr Meagles had much
      enjoyment of the time. Mr Meagles, however, thoroughly enjoyed Young
      Barnacle. As a mere flask of the golden water in the tale became a full
      fountain when it was poured out, so Mr Meagles seemed to feel that this
      small spice of Barnacle imparted to his table the flavour of the whole
      family-tree. In its presence, his frank, fine, genuine qualities paled; he
      was not so easy, he was not so natural, he was striving after something
      that did not belong to him, he was not himself. What a strange peculiarity
      on the part of Mr Meagles, and where should we find another such case!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the wet Sunday wore itself out in a wet night; and Young Barnacle
      went home in a cab, feebly smoking; and the objectionable Gowan went away
      on foot, accompanied by the objectionable dog. Pet had taken the most
      amiable pains all day to be friendly with Clennam, but Clennam had been a
      little reserved since breakfast—that is to say, would have been, if
      he had loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had gone to his own room, and had again thrown himself into the
      chair by the fire, Mr Doyce knocked at the door, candle in hand, to ask
      him how and at what hour he proposed returning on the morrow? After
      settling this question, he said a word to Mr Doyce about this Gowan—who
      would have run in his head a good deal, if he had been his rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Those are not good prospects for a painter,’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ returned Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Doyce stood, chamber-candlestick in hand, the other hand in his pocket,
      looking hard at the flame of his candle, with a certain quiet perception
      in his face that they were going to say something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought our good friend a little changed, and out of spirits, after he
      came this morning?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,’ returned Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But not his daughter?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause on both sides. Mr Doyce, still looking at the flame of
      his candle, slowly resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The truth is, he has twice taken his daughter abroad in the hope of
      separating her from Mr Gowan. He rather thinks she is disposed to like
      him, and he has painful doubts (I quite agree with him, as I dare say you
      do) of the hopefulness of such a marriage.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There—’ Clennam choked, and coughed, and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, you have taken cold,’ said Daniel Doyce. But without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—There is an engagement between them, of course?’ said Clennam
      airily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. As I am told, certainly not. It has been solicited on the gentleman’s
      part, but none has been made. Since their recent return, our friend has
      yielded to a weekly visit, but that is the utmost. Minnie would not
      deceive her father and mother. You have travelled with them, and I believe
      you know what a bond there is among them, extending even beyond this
      present life. All that there is between Miss Minnie and Mr Gowan, I have
      no doubt we see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! We see enough!’ cried Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Doyce wished him Good Night in the tone of a man who had heard a
      mournful, not to say despairing, exclamation, and who sought to infuse
      some encouragement and hope into the mind of the person by whom it had
      been uttered. Such tone was probably a part of his oddity, as one of a
      crotchety band; for how could he have heard anything of that kind, without
      Clennam’s hearing it too?
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain fell heavily on the roof, and pattered on the ground, and dripped
      among the evergreens and the leafless branches of the trees. The rain fell
      heavily, drearily. It was a night of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Clennam had not decided against falling in love with Pet; if he had had
      the weakness to do it; if he had, little by little, persuaded himself to
      set all the earnestness of his nature, all the might of his hope, and all
      the wealth of his matured character, on that cast; if he had done this and
      found that all was lost; he would have been, that night, unutterably
      miserable. As it was—
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, the rain fell heavily, drearily.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Little Dorrit’s Lover</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>Little Dorrit had not attained her twenty-second birthday without finding
      a lover. Even in the shallow Marshalsea, the ever young Archer shot off a
      few featherless arrows now and then from a mouldy bow, and winged a
      Collegian or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit’s lover, however, was not a Collegian. He was the
      sentimental son of a turnkey. His father hoped, in the fulness of time, to
      leave him the inheritance of an unstained key; and had from his early
      youth familiarised him with the duties of his office, and with an ambition
      to retain the prison-lock in the family. While the succession was yet in
      abeyance, he assisted his mother in the conduct of a snug tobacco business
      round the corner of Horsemonger Lane (his father being a non-resident
      turnkey), which could usually command a neat connection within the College
      walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years agone, when the object of his affections was wont to sit in her
      little arm-chair by the high Lodge-fender, Young John (family name,
      Chivery), a year older than herself, had eyed her with admiring wonder.
      When he had played with her in the yard, his favourite game had been to
      counterfeit locking her up in corners, and to counterfeit letting her out
      for real kisses. When he grew tall enough to peep through the keyhole of
      the great lock of the main door, he had divers times set down his father’s
      dinner, or supper, to get on as it might on the outer side thereof, while
      he stood taking cold in one eye by dint of peeping at her through that
      airy perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Young John had ever slackened in his truth in the less penetrable days
      of his boyhood, when youth is prone to wear its boots unlaced and is
      happily unconscious of digestive organs, he had soon strung it up again
      and screwed it tight. At nineteen, his hand had inscribed in chalk on that
      part of the wall which fronted her lodgings, on the occasion of her
      birthday, ‘Welcome sweet nursling of the Fairies!’ At twenty-three, the
      same hand falteringly presented cigars on Sundays to the Father of the
      Marshalsea, and Father of the queen of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John was small of stature, with rather weak legs and very weak light
      hair. One of his eyes (perhaps the eye that used to peep through the
      keyhole) was also weak, and looked larger than the other, as if it
      couldn’t collect itself. Young John was gentle likewise. But he was great
      of soul. Poetical, expansive, faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though too humble before the ruler of his heart to be sanguine, Young John
      had considered the object of his attachment in all its lights and shades.
      Following it out to blissful results, he had descried, without
      self-commendation, a fitness in it. Say things prospered, and they were
      united. She, the child of the Marshalsea; he, the lock-keeper. There was a
      fitness in that. Say he became a resident turnkey. She would officially
      succeed to the chamber she had rented so long. There was a beautiful
      propriety in that. It looked over the wall, if you stood on tip-toe; and,
      with a trellis-work of scarlet beans and a canary or so, would become a
      very Arbour. There was a charming idea in that. Then, being all in all to
      one another, there was even an appropriate grace in the lock. With the
      world shut out (except that part of it which would be shut in); with its
      troubles and disturbances only known to them by hearsay, as they would be
      described by the pilgrims tarrying with them on their way to the Insolvent
      Shrine; with the Arbour above, and the Lodge below; they would glide down
      the stream of time, in pastoral domestic happiness. Young John drew tears
      from his eyes by finishing the picture with a tombstone in the adjoining
      churchyard, close against the prison wall, bearing the following touching
      inscription: ‘Sacred to the Memory Of JOHN CHIVERY, Sixty years Turnkey,
      and fifty years Head Turnkey, Of the neighbouring Marshalsea, Who departed
      this life, universally respected, on the thirty-first of December, One
      thousand eight hundred and eighty-six, Aged eighty-three years. Also of
      his truly beloved and truly loving wife, AMY, whose maiden name was
      DORRIT, Who survived his loss not quite forty-eight hours, And who
      breathed her last in the Marshalsea aforesaid. There she was born, There
      she lived, There she died.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chivery parents were not ignorant of their son’s attachment—indeed
      it had, on some exceptional occasions, thrown him into a state of mind
      that had impelled him to conduct himself with irascibility towards the
      customers, and damage the business—but they, in their turns, had
      worked it out to desirable conclusions. Mrs Chivery, a prudent woman, had
      desired her husband to take notice that their John’s prospects of the Lock
      would certainly be strengthened by an alliance with Miss Dorrit, who had
      herself a kind of claim upon the College and was much respected there. Mrs
      Chivery had desired her husband to take notice that if, on the one hand,
      their John had means and a post of trust, on the other hand, Miss Dorrit
      had family; and that her (Mrs Chivery’s) sentiment was, that two halves
      made a whole. Mrs Chivery, speaking as a mother and not as a diplomatist,
      had then, from a different point of view, desired her husband to recollect
      that their John had never been strong, and that his love had fretted and
      worrited him enough as it was, without his being driven to do himself a
      mischief, as nobody couldn’t say he wouldn’t be if he was crossed. These
      arguments had so powerfully influenced the mind of Mr Chivery, who was a
      man of few words, that he had on sundry Sunday mornings, given his boy
      what he termed ‘a lucky touch,’ signifying that he considered such
      commendation of him to Good Fortune, preparatory to his that day declaring
      his passion and becoming triumphant. But Young John had never taken
      courage to make the declaration; and it was principally on these occasions
      that he had returned excited to the tobacco shop, and flown at the
      customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this affair, as in every other, Little Dorrit herself was the last
      person considered. Her brother and sister were aware of it, and attained a
      sort of station by making a peg of it on which to air the miserably ragged
      old fiction of the family gentility. Her sister asserted the family
      gentility by flouting the poor swain as he loitered about the prison for
      glimpses of his dear. Tip asserted the family gentility, and his own, by
      coming out in the character of the aristocratic brother, and loftily
      swaggering in the little skittle ground respecting seizures by the scruff
      of the neck, which there were looming probabilities of some gentleman
      unknown executing on some little puppy not mentioned. These were not the
      only members of the Dorrit family who turned it to account. No, no. The
      Father of the Marshalsea was supposed to know nothing about the matter, of
      course: his poor dignity could not see so low. But he took the cigars, on
      Sundays, and was glad to get them; and sometimes even condescended to walk
      up and down the yard with the donor (who was proud and hopeful then), and
      benignantly to smoke one in his society. With no less readiness and
      condescension did he receive attentions from Chivery Senior, who always
      relinquished his arm-chair and newspaper to him, when he came into the
      Lodge during one of his spells of duty; and who had even mentioned to him,
      that, if he would like at any time after dusk quietly to step out into the
      fore-court and take a look at the street, there was not much to prevent
      him. If he did not avail himself of this latter civility, it was only
      because he had lost the relish for it; inasmuch as he took everything else
      he could get, and would say at times, ‘Extremely civil person, Chivery;
      very attentive man and very respectful. Young Chivery, too; really almost
      with a delicate perception of one’s position here. A very well conducted
      family indeed, the Chiveries. Their behaviour gratifies me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The devoted Young John all this time regarded the family with reverence.
      He never dreamed of disputing their pretensions, but did homage to the
      miserable Mumbo jumbo they paraded. As to resenting any affront from <i>her</i>
      brother, he would have felt, even if he had not naturally been of a most
      pacific disposition, that to wag his tongue or lift his hand against that
      sacred gentleman would be an unhallowed act. He was sorry that his noble
      mind should take offence; still, he felt the fact to be not incompatible
      with its nobility, and sought to propitiate and conciliate that gallant
      soul. Her father, a gentleman in misfortune—a gentleman of a fine
      spirit and courtly manners, who always bore with him—he deeply
      honoured. Her sister he considered somewhat vain and proud, but a young
      lady of infinite accomplishments, who could not forget the past. It was an
      instinctive testimony to Little Dorrit’s worth and difference from all the
      rest, that the poor young fellow honoured and loved her for being simply
      what she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tobacco business round the corner of Horsemonger Lane was carried out
      in a rural establishment one story high, which had the benefit of the air
      from the yards of Horsemonger Lane jail, and the advantage of a retired
      walk under the wall of that pleasant establishment. The business was of
      too modest a character to support a life-size Highlander, but it
      maintained a little one on a bracket on the door-post, who looked like a
      fallen Cherub that had found it necessary to take to a kilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the portal thus decorated, one Sunday after an early dinner of baked
      viands, Young John issued forth on his usual Sunday errand; not
      empty-handed, but with his offering of cigars. He was neatly attired in a
      plum-coloured coat, with as large a collar of black velvet as his figure
      could carry; a silken waistcoat, bedecked with golden sprigs; a chaste
      neckerchief much in vogue at that day, representing a preserve of lilac
      pheasants on a buff ground; pantaloons so highly decorated with
      side-stripes that each leg was a three-stringed lute; and a hat of state
      very high and hard. When the prudent Mrs Chivery perceived that in
      addition to these adornments her John carried a pair of white kid gloves,
      and a cane like a little finger-post, surmounted by an ivory hand
      marshalling him the way that he should go; and when she saw him, in this
      heavy marching order, turn the corner to the right; she remarked to Mr
      Chivery, who was at home at the time, that she thought she knew which way
      the wind blew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Collegians were entertaining a considerable number of visitors that
      Sunday afternoon, and their Father kept his room for the purpose of
      receiving presentations. After making the tour of the yard, Little
      Dorrit’s lover with a hurried heart went up-stairs, and knocked with his
      knuckles at the Father’s door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come in, come in!’ said a gracious voice. The Father’s voice, her
      father’s, the Marshalsea’s father’s. He was seated in his black velvet
      cap, with his newspaper, three-and-sixpence accidentally left on the
      table, and two chairs arranged. Everything prepared for holding his Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, Young John! How do you do, how do you do!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pretty well, I thank you, sir. I hope you are the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, John Chivery; yes. Nothing to complain of.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have taken the liberty, sir, of—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Eh?’ The Father of the Marshalsea always lifted up his eyebrows at this
      point, and became amiably distraught and smilingly absent in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—A few cigars, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ (For the moment, excessively surprised.) ‘Thank you, Young John,
      thank you. But really, I am afraid I am too—No? Well then, I will
      say no more about it. Put them on the mantelshelf, if you please, Young
      John. And sit down, sit down. You are not a stranger, John.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir, I am sure—Miss;’ here Young John turned the great
      hat round and round upon his left-hand, like a slowly twirling mouse-cage;
      ‘Miss Amy quite well, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, John, yes; very well. She is out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, John. Miss Amy is gone for an airing. My young people all go out a
      good deal. But at their time of life, it’s natural, John.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very much so, I am sure, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An airing. An airing. Yes.’ He was blandly tapping his fingers on the
      table, and casting his eyes up at the window. ‘Amy has gone for an airing
      on the Iron Bridge. She has become quite partial to the Iron Bridge of
      late, and seems to like to walk there better than anywhere.’ He returned
      to conversation. ‘Your father is not on duty at present, I think, John?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, he comes on later in the afternoon.’ Another twirl of the great
      hat, and then Young John said, rising, ‘I am afraid I must wish you good
      day, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So soon? Good day, Young John. Nay, nay,’ with the utmost condescension,
      ‘never mind your glove, John. Shake hands with it on. You are no stranger
      here, you know.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Highly gratified by the kindness of his reception, Young John descended
      the staircase. On his way down he met some Collegians bringing up visitors
      to be presented, and at that moment Mr Dorrit happened to call over the
      banisters with particular distinctness, ‘Much obliged to you for your
      little testimonial, John!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit’s lover very soon laid down his penny on the tollplate of
      the Iron Bridge, and came upon it looking about him for the well-known and
      well-beloved figure. At first he feared she was not there; but as he
      walked on towards the Middlesex side, he saw her standing still, looking
      at the water. She was absorbed in thought, and he wondered what she might
      be thinking about. There were the piles of city roofs and chimneys, more
      free from smoke than on week-days; and there were the distant masts and
      steeples. Perhaps she was thinking about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit mused so long, and was so entirely preoccupied, that
      although her lover stood quiet for what he thought was a long time, and
      twice or thrice retired and came back again to the former spot, still she
      did not move. So, in the end, he made up his mind to go on, and seem to
      come upon her casually in passing, and speak to her. The place was quiet,
      and now or never was the time to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on, and she did not appear to hear his steps until he was close
      upon her. When he said ‘Miss Dorrit!’ she started and fell back from him,
      with an expression in her face of fright and something like dislike that
      caused him unutterable dismay. She had often avoided him before—always,
      indeed, for a long, long while. She had turned away and glided off so
      often when she had seen him coming toward her, that the unfortunate Young
      John could not think it accidental. But he had hoped that it might be
      shyness, her retiring character, her foreknowledge of the state of his
      heart, anything short of aversion. Now, that momentary look had said,
      ‘You, of all people! I would rather have seen any one on earth than you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but a momentary look, inasmuch as she checked it, and said in her
      soft little voice, ‘Oh, Mr John! Is it you?’ But she felt what it had
      been, as he felt what it had been; and they stood looking at one another
      equally confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy, I am afraid I disturbed you by speaking to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, rather. I—I came here to be alone, and I thought I was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy, I took the liberty of walking this way, because Mr Dorrit
      chanced to mention, when I called upon him just now, that you—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She caused him more dismay than before by suddenly murmuring, ‘O father,
      father!’ in a heartrending tone, and turning her face away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy, I hope I don’t give you any uneasiness by naming Mr Dorrit. I
      assure you I found him very well and in the best of Spirits, and he showed
      me even more than his usual kindness; being so very kind as to say that I
      was not a stranger there, and in all ways gratifying me very much.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the inexpressible consternation of her lover, Little Dorrit, with her
      hands to her averted face, and rocking herself where she stood as if she
      were in pain, murmured, ‘O father, how can you! O dear, dear father, how
      can you, can you, do it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow stood gazing at her, overflowing with sympathy, but not
      knowing what to make of this, until, having taken out her handkerchief and
      put it to her still averted face, she hurried away. At first he remained
      stock still; then hurried after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy, pray! Will you have the goodness to stop a moment? Miss Amy, if
      it comes to that, let <i>me</i> go. I shall go out of my senses, if I have
      to think that I have driven you away like this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His trembling voice and unfeigned earnestness brought Little Dorrit to a
      stop. ‘Oh, I don’t know what to do,’ she cried, ‘I don’t know what to do!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To Young John, who had never seen her bereft of her quiet self-command,
      who had seen her from her infancy ever so reliable and self-suppressed,
      there was a shock in her distress, and in having to associate himself with
      it as its cause, that shook him from his great hat to the pavement. He
      felt it necessary to explain himself. He might be misunderstood—supposed
      to mean something, or to have done something, that had never entered into
      his imagination. He begged her to hear him explain himself, as the
      greatest favour she could show him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy, I know very well that your family is far above mine. It were
      vain to conceal it. There never was a Chivery a gentleman that ever I
      heard of, and I will not commit the meanness of making a false
      representation on a subject so momentous. Miss Amy, I know very well that
      your high-souled brother, and likewise your spirited sister, spurn me from
      a height. What I have to do is to respect them, to wish to be admitted to
      their friendship, to look up at the eminence on which they are placed from
      my lowlier station—for, whether viewed as tobacco or viewed as the
      lock, I well know it is lowly—and ever wish them well and happy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There really was a genuineness in the poor fellow, and a contrast between
      the hardness of his hat and the softness of his heart (albeit, perhaps, of
      his head, too), that was moving. Little Dorrit entreated him to disparage
      neither himself nor his station, and, above all things, to divest himself
      of any idea that she supposed hers to be superior. This gave him a little
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Amy,’ he then stammered, ‘I have had for a long time—ages they
      seem to me—Revolving ages—a heart-cherished wish to say
      something to you. May I say it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit involuntarily started from his side again, with the faintest
      shadow of her former look; conquering that, she went on at great speed
      half across the Bridge without replying!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I—Miss Amy, I but ask the question humbly—may I say it? I
      have been so unlucky already in giving you pain without having any such
      intentions, before the holy Heavens! that there is no fear of my saying it
      unless I have your leave. I can be miserable alone, I can be cut up by
      myself, why should I also make miserable and cut up one that I would fling
      myself off that parapet to give half a moment’s joy to! Not that that’s
      much to do, for I’d do it for twopence.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mournfulness of his spirits, and the gorgeousness of his appearance,
      might have made him ridiculous, but that his delicacy made him
      respectable. Little Dorrit learnt from it what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you please, John Chivery,’ she returned, trembling, but in a quiet
      way, ‘since you are so considerate as to ask me whether you shall say any
      more—if you please, no.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never, Miss Amy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, if you please. Never.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O Lord!’ gasped Young John.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But perhaps you will let me, instead, say something to you. I want to say
      it earnestly, and with as plain a meaning as it is possible to express.
      When you think of us, John—I mean my brother, and sister, and me—don’t
      think of us as being any different from the rest; for, whatever we once
      were (which I hardly know) we ceased to be long ago, and never can be any
      more. It will be much better for you, and much better for others, if you
      will do that instead of what you are doing now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John dolefully protested that he would try to bear it in mind, and
      would be heartily glad to do anything she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to me,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘think as little of me as you can; the
      less, the better. When you think of me at all, John, let it only be as the
      child you have seen grow up in the prison with one set of duties always
      occupying her; as a weak, retired, contented, unprotected girl. I
      particularly want you to remember, that when I come outside the gate, I am
      unprotected and solitary.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He would try to do anything she wished. But why did Miss Amy so much want
      him to remember that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because,’ returned Little Dorrit, ‘I know I can then quite trust you not
      to forget to-day, and not to say any more to me. You are so generous that
      I know I can trust to you for that; and I do and I always will. I am going
      to show you, at once, that I fully trust you. I like this place where we
      are speaking better than any place I know;’ her slight colour had faded,
      but her lover thought he saw it coming back just then; ‘and I may be often
      here. I know it is only necessary for me to tell you so, to be quite sure
      that you will never come here again in search of me. And I am—quite
      sure!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She might rely upon it, said Young John. He was a miserable wretch, but
      her word was more than a law for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And good-bye, John,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘And I hope you will have a good
      wife one day, and be a happy man. I am sure you will deserve to be happy,
      and you will be, John.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she held out her hand to him with these words, the heart that was under
      the waistcoat of sprigs—mere slop-work, if the truth must be known—swelled
      to the size of the heart of a gentleman; and the poor common little
      fellow, having no room to hold it, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, don’t cry,’ said Little Dorrit piteously. ‘Don’t, don’t! Good-bye,
      John. God bless you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good-bye, Miss Amy. Good-bye!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he left her: first observing that she sat down on the corner of a
      seat, and not only rested her little hand upon the rough wall, but laid
      her face against it too, as if her head were heavy, and her mind were sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an affecting illustration of the fallacy of human projects, to
      behold her lover, with the great hat pulled over his eyes, the velvet
      collar turned up as if it rained, the plum-coloured coat buttoned to
      conceal the silken waistcoat of golden sprigs, and the little
      direction-post pointing inexorably home, creeping along by the worst
      back-streets, and composing, as he went, the following new inscription for
      a tombstone in St George’s Churchyard:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here lie the mortal remains Of JOHN CHIVERY, Never anything worth
      mentioning, Who died about the end of the year one thousand eight hundred
      and twenty-six, Of a broken heart, Requesting with his last breath that
      the word AMY might be inscribed over his ashes, which was accordingly
      directed to be done, By his afflicted Parents.’

	<h3 epub:type="title">The Father of the Marshalsea in two or three Relations</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>The brothers William and Frederick Dorrit, walking up and down the
      College-yard—of course on the aristocratic or Pump side, for the
      Father made it a point of his state to be chary of going among his
      children on the Poor side, except on Sunday mornings, Christmas Days, and
      other occasions of ceremony, in the observance whereof he was very
      punctual, and at which times he laid his hand upon the heads of their
      infants, and blessed those young insolvents with a benignity that was
      highly edifying—the brothers, walking up and down the College-yard
      together, were a memorable sight. Frederick the free, was so humbled,
      bowed, withered, and faded; William the bond, was so courtly,
      condescending, and benevolently conscious of a position; that in this
      regard only, if in no other, the brothers were a spectacle to wonder at.
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0206m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0206m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0206.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      They walked up and down the yard on the evening of Little Dorrit’s Sunday
      interview with her lover on the Iron Bridge. The cares of state were over
      for that day, the Drawing Room had been well attended, several new
      presentations had taken place, the three-and-sixpence accidentally left on
      the table had accidentally increased to twelve shillings, and the Father
      of the Marshalsea refreshed himself with a whiff of cigar. As he walked up
      and down, affably accommodating his step to the shuffle of his brother,
      not proud in his superiority, but considerate of that poor creature,
      bearing with him, and breathing toleration of his infirmities in every
      little puff of smoke that issued from his lips and aspired to get over the
      spiked wall, he was a sight to wonder at.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother Frederick of the dim eye, palsied hand, bent form, and groping
      mind, submissively shuffled at his side, accepting his patronage as he
      accepted every incident of the labyrinthian world in which he had got
      lost. He held the usual screwed bit of whitey-brown paper in his hand,
      from which he ever and again unscrewed a spare pinch of snuff. That
      falteringly taken, he would glance at his brother not unadmiringly, put
      his hands behind him, and shuffle on so at his side until he took another
      pinch, or stood still to look about him—perchance suddenly missing
      his clarionet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The College visitors were melting away as the shades of night drew on, but
      the yard was still pretty full, the Collegians being mostly out, seeing
      their friends to the Lodge. As the brothers paced the yard, William the
      bond looked about him to receive salutes, returned them by graciously
      lifting off his hat, and, with an engaging air, prevented Frederick the
      free from running against the company, or being jostled against the wall.
      The Collegians as a body were not easily impressible, but even they,
      according to their various ways of wondering, appeared to find in the two
      brothers a sight to wonder at.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are a little low this evening, Frederick,’ said the Father of the
      Marshalsea. ‘Anything the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The matter?’ He stared for a moment, and then dropped his head and eyes
      again. ‘No, William, no. Nothing is the matter.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you could be persuaded to smarten yourself up a little, Frederick—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Aye, aye!’ said the old man hurriedly. ‘But I can’t be. I can’t be. Don’t
      talk so. That’s all over.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea glanced at a passing Collegian with whom he
      was on friendly terms, as who should say, ‘An enfeebled old man, this; but
      he is my brother, sir, my brother, and the voice of Nature is potent!’ and
      steered his brother clear of the handle of the pump by the threadbare
      sleeve. Nothing would have been wanting to the perfection of his character
      as a fraternal guide, philosopher and friend, if he had only steered his
      brother clear of ruin, instead of bringing it upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think, William,’ said the object of his affectionate consideration,
      ‘that I am tired, and will go home to bed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Frederick,’ returned the other, ‘don’t let me detain you; don’t
      sacrifice your inclination to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Late hours, and a heated atmosphere, and years, I suppose,’ said
      Frederick, ‘weaken me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Frederick,’ returned the Father of the Marshalsea, ‘do you think
      you are sufficiently careful of yourself? Do you think your habits are as
      precise and methodical as—shall I say as mine are? Not to revert
      again to that little eccentricity which I mentioned just now, I doubt if
      you take air and exercise enough, Frederick. Here is the parade, always at
      your service. Why not use it more regularly than you do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hah!’ sighed the other. ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it is of no use saying yes, yes, my dear Frederick,’ the Father of
      the Marshalsea in his mild wisdom persisted, ‘unless you act on that
      assent. Consider my case, Frederick. I am a kind of example. Necessity and
      time have taught me what to do. At certain stated hours of the day, you
      will find me on the parade, in my room, in the Lodge, reading the paper,
      receiving company, eating and drinking. I have impressed upon Amy during
      many years, that I must have my meals (for instance) punctually. Amy has
      grown up in a sense of the importance of these arrangements, and you know
      what a good girl she is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother only sighed again, as he plodded dreamily along, ‘Hah! Yes,
      yes, yes, yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear fellow,’ said the Father of the Marshalsea, laying his hand upon
      his shoulder, and mildly rallying him—mildly, because of his
      weakness, poor dear soul; ‘you said that before, and it does not express
      much, Frederick, even if it means much. I wish I could rouse you, my good
      Frederick; you want to be roused.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, William, yes. No doubt,’ returned the other, lifting his dim eyes to
      his face. ‘But I am not like you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea said, with a shrug of modest
      self-depreciation, ‘Oh! You might be like me, my dear Frederick; you might
      be, if you chose!’ and forbore, in the magnanimity of his strength, to
      press his fallen brother further.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great deal of leave-taking going on in corners, as was usual
      on Sunday nights; and here and there in the dark, some poor woman, wife or
      mother, was weeping with a new Collegian. The time had been when the
      Father himself had wept, in the shades of that yard, as his own poor wife
      had wept. But it was many years ago; and now he was like a passenger
      aboard ship in a long voyage, who has recovered from sea-sickness, and is
      impatient of that weakness in the fresher passengers taken aboard at the
      last port. He was inclined to remonstrate, and to express his opinion that
      people who couldn’t get on without crying, had no business there. In
      manner, if not in words, he always testified his displeasure at these
      interruptions of the general harmony; and it was so well understood, that
      delinquents usually withdrew if they were aware of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this Sunday evening, he accompanied his brother to the gate with an air
      of endurance and clemency; being in a bland temper and graciously disposed
      to overlook the tears. In the flaring gaslight of the Lodge, several
      Collegians were basking; some taking leave of visitors, and some who had
      no visitors, watching the frequent turning of the key, and conversing with
      one another and with Mr Chivery. The paternal entrance made a sensation of
      course; and Mr Chivery, touching his hat (in a short manner though) with
      his key, hoped he found himself tolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, Chivery, quite well. And you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chivery said in a low growl, ‘Oh! <i>he</i> was all right.’ Which was
      his general way of acknowledging inquiries after his health when a little
      sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I had a visit from Young John to-day, Chivery. And very smart he looked,
      I assure you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr Chivery had heard. Mr Chivery must confess, however, that his wish
      was that the boy didn’t lay out so much money upon it. For what did it
      bring him in? It only brought him in wexation. And he could get that
      anywhere for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How vexation, Chivery?’ asked the benignant father.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No odds,’ returned Mr Chivery. ‘Never mind. Mr Frederick going out?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Chivery, my brother is going home to bed. He is tired, and not quite
      well. Take care, Frederick, take care. Good night, my dear Frederick!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaking hands with his brother, and touching his greasy hat to the company
      in the Lodge, Frederick slowly shuffled out of the door which Mr Chivery
      unlocked for him. The Father of the Marshalsea showed the amiable
      solicitude of a superior being that he should come to no harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Be so kind as to keep the door open a moment, Chivery, that I may see him
      go along the passage and down the steps. Take care, Frederick! (He is very
      infirm.) Mind the steps! (He is so very absent.) Be careful how you cross,
      Frederick. (I really don’t like the notion of his going wandering at
      large, he is so extremely liable to be run over.)’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, and with a face expressive of many uneasy doubts and
      much anxious guardianship, he turned his regards upon the assembled
      company in the Lodge: so plainly indicating that his brother was to be
      pitied for not being under lock and key, that an opinion to that effect
      went round among the Collegians assembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not receive it with unqualified assent; on the contrary, he
      said, No, gentlemen, no; let them not misunderstand him. His brother
      Frederick was much broken, no doubt, and it might be more comfortable to
      himself (the Father of the Marshalsea) to know that he was safe within the
      walls. Still, it must be remembered that to support an existence there
      during many years, required a certain combination of qualities—he
      did not say high qualities, but qualities—moral qualities. Now, had
      his brother Frederick that peculiar union of qualities? Gentlemen, he was
      a most excellent man, a most gentle, tender, and estimable man, with the
      simplicity of a child; but would he, though unsuited for most other
      places, do for that place? No; he said confidently, no! And, he said,
      Heaven forbid that Frederick should be there in any other character than
      in his present voluntary character! Gentlemen, whoever came to that
      College, to remain there a length of time, must have strength of character
      to go through a good deal and to come out of a good deal. Was his beloved
      brother Frederick that man? No. They saw him, even as it was, crushed.
      Misfortune crushed him. He had not power of recoil enough, not elasticity
      enough, to be a long time in such a place, and yet preserve his
      self-respect and feel conscious that he was a gentleman. Frederick had not
      (if he might use the expression) Power enough to see in any delicate
      little attentions and—and—Testimonials that he might under
      such circumstances receive, the goodness of human nature, the fine spirit
      animating the Collegians as a community, and at the same time no
      degradation to himself, and no depreciation of his claims as a gentleman.
      Gentlemen, God bless you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the homily with which he improved and pointed the occasion to the
      company in the Lodge before turning into the sallow yard again, and going
      with his own poor shabby dignity past the Collegian in the dressing-gown
      who had no coat, and past the Collegian in the sea-side slippers who had
      no shoes, and past the stout greengrocer Collegian in the corduroy
      knee-breeches who had no cares, and past the lean clerk Collegian in
      buttonless black who had no hopes, up his own poor shabby staircase to his
      own poor shabby room.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, the table was laid for his supper, and his old grey gown was ready
      for him on his chair-back at the fire. His daughter put her little
      prayer-book in her pocket—had she been praying for pity on all
      prisoners and captives!—and rose to welcome him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle had gone home, then? she asked him, as she changed his coat and gave
      him his black velvet cap. Yes, uncle had gone home. Had her father enjoyed
      his walk? Why, not much, Amy; not much. No! Did he not feel quite well?
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood behind him, leaning over his chair so lovingly, he looked
      with downcast eyes at the fire. An uneasiness stole over him that was like
      a touch of shame; and when he spoke, as he presently did, it was in an
      unconnected and embarrassed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Something, I—hem!—I don’t know what, has gone wrong with
      Chivery. He is not—ha!—not nearly so obliging and attentive as
      usual to-night. It—hem!—it’s a little thing, but it puts me
      out, my love. It’s impossible to forget,’ turning his hands over and over
      and looking closely at them, ‘that—hem!—that in such a life as
      mine, I am unfortunately dependent on these men for something every hour
      in the day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her arm was on his shoulder, but she did not look in his face while he
      spoke. Bending her head she looked another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I—hem!—I can’t think, Amy, what has given Chivery offence. He
      is generally so—so very attentive and respectful. And to-night he
      was quite—quite short with me. Other people there too! Why, good
      Heaven! if I was to lose the support and recognition of Chivery and his
      brother officers, I might starve to death here.’ While he spoke, he was
      opening and shutting his hands like valves; so conscious all the time of
      that touch of shame, that he shrunk before his own knowledge of his
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I—ha!—I can’t think what it’s owing to. I am sure I cannot
      imagine what the cause of it is. There was a certain Jackson here once, a
      turnkey of the name of Jackson (I don’t think you can remember him, my
      dear, you were very young), and—hem!—and he had a—brother,
      and this—young brother paid his addresses to—at least, did not
      go so far as to pay his addresses to—but admired—respectfully
      admired—the—not daughter, the sister—of one of us; a
      rather distinguished Collegian; I may say, very much so. His name was
      Captain Martin; and he consulted me on the question whether it was
      necessary that his daughter—sister—should hazard offending the
      turnkey brother by being too—ha!—too plain with the other
      brother. Captain Martin was a gentleman and a man of honour, and I put it
      to him first to give me his—his own opinion. Captain Martin (highly
      respected in the army) then unhesitatingly said that it appeared to him
      that his—hem!—sister was not called upon to understand the
      young man too distinctly, and that she might lead him on—I am
      doubtful whether “lead him on” was Captain Martin’s exact expression:
      indeed I think he said tolerate him—on her father’s—I should
      say, brother’s—account. I hardly know how I have strayed into this
      story. I suppose it has been through being unable to account for Chivery;
      but as to the connection between the two, I don’t see—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice died away, as if she could not bear the pain of hearing him, and
      her hand had gradually crept to his lips. For a little while there was a
      dead silence and stillness; and he remained shrunk in his chair, and she
      remained with her arm round his neck and her head bowed down upon his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      His supper was cooking in a saucepan on the fire, and, when she moved, it
      was to make it ready for him on the table. He took his usual seat, she
      took hers, and he began his meal. They did not, as yet, look at one
      another. By little and little he began; laying down his knife and fork
      with a noise, taking things up sharply, biting at his bread as if he were
      offended with it, and in other similar ways showing that he was out of
      sorts. At length he pushed his plate from him, and spoke aloud; with the
      strangest inconsistency.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What does it matter whether I eat or starve? What does it matter whether
      such a blighted life as mine comes to an end, now, next week, or next
      year? What am I worth to anyone? A poor prisoner, fed on alms and broken
      victuals; a squalid, disgraced wretch!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father, father!’ As he rose she went on her knees to him, and held up her
      hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy,’ he went on in a suppressed voice, trembling violently, and looking
      at her as wildly as if he had gone mad. ‘I tell you, if you could see me
      as your mother saw me, you wouldn’t believe it to be the creature you have
      only looked at through the bars of this cage. I was young, I was
      accomplished, I was good-looking, I was independent—by God I was,
      child!—and people sought me out, and envied me. Envied me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear father!’ She tried to take down the shaking arm that he flourished
      in the air, but he resisted, and put her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I had but a picture of myself in those days, though it was ever so ill
      done, you would be proud of it, you would be proud of it. But I have no
      such thing. Now, let me be a warning! Let no man,’ he cried, looking
      haggardly about, ‘fail to preserve at least that little of the times of
      his prosperity and respect. Let his children have that clue to what he
      was. Unless my face, when I am dead, subsides into the long departed look—they
      say such things happen, I don’t know—my children will have never
      seen me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father, father!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O despise me, despise me! Look away from me, don’t listen to me, stop me,
      blush for me, cry for me—even you, Amy! Do it, do it! I do it to
      myself! I am hardened now, I have sunk too low to care long even for
      that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear father, loved father, darling of my heart!’ She was clinging to him
      with her arms, and she got him to drop into his chair again, and caught at
      the raised arm, and tried to put it round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let it lie there, father. Look at me, father, kiss me, father! Only think
      of me, father, for one little moment!’

      Still he went on in the same wild way, though it was gradually breaking
      down into a miserable whining.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And yet I have some respect here. I have made some stand against it. I am
      not quite trodden down. Go out and ask who is the chief person in the
      place. They’ll tell you it’s your father. Go out and ask who is never
      trifled with, and who is always treated with some delicacy. They’ll say,
      your father. Go out and ask what funeral here (it must be here, I know it
      can be nowhere else) will make more talk, and perhaps more grief, than any
      that has ever gone out at the gate. They’ll say your father’s. Well then.
      Amy! Amy! Is your father so universally despised? Is there nothing to
      redeem him? Will you have nothing to remember him by but his ruin and
      decay? Will you be able to have no affection for him when he is gone, poor
      castaway, gone?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He burst into tears of maudlin pity for himself, and at length suffering
      her to embrace him and take charge of him, let his grey head rest against
      her cheek, and bewailed his wretchedness. Presently he changed the subject
      of his lamentations, and clasping his hands about her as she embraced him,
      cried, O Amy, his motherless, forlorn child! O the days that he had seen
      her careful and laborious for him! Then he reverted to himself, and weakly
      told her how much better she would have loved him if she had known him in
      his vanished character, and how he would have married her to a gentleman
      who should have been proud of her as his daughter, and how (at which he
      cried again) she should first have ridden at his fatherly side on her own
      horse, and how the crowd (by which he meant in effect the people who had
      given him the twelve shillings he then had in his pocket) should have
      trudged the dusty roads respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, now boasting, now despairing, in either fit a captive with the
      jail-rot upon him, and the impurity of his prison worn into the grain of
      his soul, he revealed his degenerate state to his affectionate child. No
      one else ever beheld him in the details of his humiliation. Little recked
      the Collegians who were laughing in their rooms over his late address in
      the Lodge, what a serious picture they had in their obscure gallery of the
      Marshalsea that Sunday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a classical daughter once—perhaps—who ministered to
      her father in his prison as her mother had ministered to her. Little
      Dorrit, though of the unheroic modern stock and mere English, did much
      more, in comforting her father’s wasted heart upon her innocent breast,
      and turning to it a fountain of love and fidelity that never ran dry or
      waned through all his years of famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soothed him; asked him for his forgiveness if she had been, or seemed
      to have been, undutiful; told him, Heaven knows truly, that she could not
      honour him more if he were the favourite of Fortune and the whole world
      acknowledged him. When his tears were dried, and he sobbed in his weakness
      no longer, and was free from that touch of shame, and had recovered his
      usual bearing, she prepared the remains of his supper afresh, and, sitting
      by his side, rejoiced to see him eat and drink. For now he sat in his
      black velvet cap and old grey gown, magnanimous again; and would have
      comported himself towards any Collegian who might have looked in to ask
      his advice, like a great moral Lord Chesterfield, or Master of the ethical
      ceremonies of the Marshalsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      To keep his attention engaged, she talked with him about his wardrobe;
      when he was pleased to say, that Yes, indeed, those shirts she proposed
      would be exceedingly acceptable, for those he had were worn out, and,
      being ready-made, had never fitted him. Being conversational, and in a
      reasonable flow of spirits, he then invited her attention to his coat as
      it hung behind the door: remarking that the Father of the place would set
      an indifferent example to his children, already disposed to be slovenly,
      if he went among them out at elbows. He was jocular, too, as to the
      heeling of his shoes; but became grave on the subject of his cravat, and
      promised her that, when she could afford it, she should buy him a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he smoked out his cigar in peace, she made his bed, and put the
      small room in order for his repose. Being weary then, owing to the
      advanced hour and his emotions, he came out of his chair to bless her and
      wish her Good night. All this time he had never once thought of <i>her</i>
      dress, her shoes, her need of anything. No other person upon earth, save
      herself, could have been so unmindful of her wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her many times with ‘Bless you, my love. Good night, my dear!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But her gentle breast had been so deeply wounded by what she had seen of
      him that she was unwilling to leave him alone, lest he should lament and
      despair again. ‘Father, dear, I am not tired; let me come back presently,
      when you are in bed, and sit by you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked her, with an air of protection, if she felt solitary?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then come back by all means, my love.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall be very quiet, father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t think of me, my dear,’ he said, giving her his kind permission
      fully. ‘Come back by all means.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be dozing when she returned, and she put the low fire
      together very softly lest she should awake him. But he overheard her, and
      called out who was that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Only Amy, father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy, my child, come here. I want to say a word to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised himself a little in his low bed, as she kneeled beside it to
      bring her face near him; and put his hand between hers. O! Both the
      private father and the Father of the Marshalsea were strong within him
      then.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My love, you have had a life of hardship here. No companions, no
      recreations, many cares I am afraid?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t think of that, dear. I never do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You know my position, Amy. I have not been able to do much for you; but
      all I have been able to do, I have done.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, my dear father,’ she rejoined, kissing him. ‘I know, I know.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am in the twenty-third year of my life here,’ he said, with a catch in
      his breath that was not so much a sob as an irrepressible sound of
      self-approval, the momentary outburst of a noble consciousness. ‘It is all
      I could do for my children—I have done it. Amy, my love, you are by
      far the best loved of the three; I have had you principally in my mind—whatever
      I have done for your sake, my dear child, I have done freely and without
      murmuring.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the wisdom that holds the clue to all hearts and all mysteries, can
      surely know to what extent a man, especially a man brought down as this
      man had been, can impose upon himself. Enough, for the present place, that
      he lay down with wet eyelashes, serene, in a manner majestic, after
      bestowing his life of degradation as a sort of portion on the devoted
      child upon whom its miseries had fallen so heavily, and whose love alone
      had saved him to be even what he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      That child had no doubts, asked herself no question, for she was but too
      content to see him with a lustre round his head. Poor dear, good dear,
      truest, kindest, dearest, were the only words she had for him, as she
      hushed him to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never left him all that night. As if she had done him a wrong which
      her tenderness could hardly repair, she sat by him in his sleep, at times
      softly kissing him with suspended breath, and calling him in a whisper by
      some endearing name. At times she stood aside so as not to intercept the
      low fire-light, and, watching him when it fell upon his sleeping face,
      wondered did he look now at all as he had looked when he was prosperous
      and happy; as he had so touched her by imagining that he might look once
      more in that awful time. At the thought of that time, she kneeled beside
      his bed again, and prayed, ‘O spare his life! O save him to me! O look
      down upon my dear, long-suffering, unfortunate, much-changed, dear dear
      father!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until the morning came to protect him and encourage him, did she give
      him a last kiss and leave the small room. When she had stolen down-stairs,
      and along the empty yard, and had crept up to her own high garret, the
      smokeless housetops and the distant country hills were discernible over
      the wall in the clear morning. As she gently opened the window, and looked
      eastward down the prison yard, the spikes upon the wall were tipped with
      red, then made a sullen purple pattern on the sun as it came flaming up
      into the heavens. The spikes had never looked so sharp and cruel, nor the
      bars so heavy, nor the prison space so gloomy and contracted. She thought
      of the sunrise on rolling rivers, of the sunrise on wide seas, of the
      sunrise on rich landscapes, of the sunrise on great forests where the
      birds were waking and the trees were rustling; and she looked down into
      the living grave on which the sun had risen, with her father in it
      three-and-twenty years, and said, in a burst of sorrow and compassion,
      ‘No, no, I have never seen him in my life!’

<p>If Young John Chivery had had the inclination and the power to write a
      satire on family pride, he would have had no need to go for an avenging
      illustration out of the family of his beloved. He would have found it
      amply in that gallant brother and that dainty sister, so steeped in mean
      experiences, and so loftily conscious of the family name; so ready to beg
      or borrow from the poorest, to eat of anybody’s bread, spend anybody’s
      money, drink from anybody’s cup and break it afterwards. To have painted
      the sordid facts of their lives, and they throughout invoking the death’s
      head apparition of the family gentility to come and scare their
      benefactors, would have made Young John a satirist of the first water.

      Tip had turned his liberty to hopeful account by becoming a
      billiard-marker. He had troubled himself so little as to the means of his
      release, that Clennam scarcely needed to have been at the pains of
      impressing the mind of Mr Plornish on that subject. Whoever had paid him
      the compliment, he very readily accepted the compliment with <i>his</i>
      compliments, and there was an end of it. Issuing forth from the gate on
      these easy terms, he became a billiard-marker; and now occasionally looked
      in at the little skittle-ground in a green Newmarket coat (second-hand),
      with a shining collar and bright buttons (new), and drank the beer of the
      Collegians.
    </p>
    <p>
      One solid stationary point in the looseness of this gentleman’s character
      was, that he respected and admired his sister Amy. The feeling had never
      induced him to spare her a moment’s uneasiness, or to put himself to any
      restraint or inconvenience on her account; but with that Marshalsea taint
      upon his love, he loved her. The same rank Marshalsea flavour was to be
      recognised in his distinctly perceiving that she sacrificed her life to
      her father, and in his having no idea that she had done anything for
      himself.

      When this spirited young man and his sister had begun systematically to
      produce the family skeleton for the overawing of the College, this
      narrative cannot precisely state. Probably at about the period when they
      began to dine on the College charity. It is certain that the more reduced
      and necessitous they were, the more pompously the skeleton emerged from
      its tomb; and that when there was anything particularly shabby in the
      wind, the skeleton always came out with the ghastliest flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit was late on the Monday morning, for her father slept late,
      and afterwards there was his breakfast to prepare and his room to arrange.
      She had no engagement to go out to work, however, and therefore stayed
      with him until, with Maggy’s help, she had put everything right about him,
      and had seen him off upon his morning walk (of twenty yards or so) to the
      coffee-house to read the paper. She then got on her bonnet and went out,
      having been anxious to get out much sooner. There was, as usual, a
      cessation of the small-talk in the Lodge as she passed through it; and a
      Collegian who had come in on Saturday night, received the intimation from
      the elbow of a more seasoned Collegian, ‘Look out. Here she is!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to see her sister, but when she got round to Mr Cripples’s, she
      found that both her sister and her uncle had gone to the theatre where
      they were engaged. Having taken thought of this probability by the way,
      and having settled that in such case she would follow them, she set off
      afresh for the theatre, which was on that side of the river, and not very
      far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit was almost as ignorant of the ways of theatres as of the
      ways of gold mines, and when she was directed to a furtive sort of door,
      with a curious up-all-night air about it, that appeared to be ashamed of
      itself and to be hiding in an alley, she hesitated to approach it; being
      further deterred by the sight of some half-dozen close-shaved gentlemen
      with their hats very strangely on, who were lounging about the door,
      looking not at all unlike Collegians. On her applying to them, reassured
      by this resemblance, for a direction to Miss Dorrit, they made way for her
      to enter a dark hall—it was more like a great grim lamp gone out
      than anything else—where she could hear the distant playing of music
      and the sound of dancing feet. A man so much in want of airing that he had
      a blue mould upon him, sat watching this dark place from a hole in a
      corner, like a spider; and he told her that he would send a message up to
      Miss Dorrit by the first lady or gentleman who went through. The first
      lady who went through had a roll of music, half in her muff and half out
      of it, and was in such a tumbled condition altogether, that it seemed as
      if it would be an act of kindness to iron her. But as she was very
      good-natured, and said, ‘Come with me; I’ll soon find Miss Dorrit for
      you,’ Miss Dorrit’s sister went with her, drawing nearer and nearer at
      every step she took in the darkness to the sound of music and the sound of
      dancing feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last they came into a maze of dust, where a quantity of people were
      tumbling over one another, and where there was such a confusion of
      unaccountable shapes of beams, bulkheads, brick walls, ropes, and rollers,
      and such a mixing of gaslight and daylight, that they seemed to have got
      on the wrong side of the pattern of the universe. Little Dorrit, left to
      herself, and knocked against by somebody every moment, was quite
      bewildered, when she heard her sister’s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, good gracious, Amy, what ever brought you here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wanted to see you, Fanny dear; and as I am going out all day to-morrow,
      and knew you might be engaged all day to-day, I thought—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But the idea, Amy, of <i>you</i> coming behind! I never did!’ As her
      sister said this in no very cordial tone of welcome, she conducted her to
      a more open part of the maze, where various golden chairs and tables were
      heaped together, and where a number of young ladies were sitting on
      anything they could find, chattering. All these young ladies wanted
      ironing, and all had a curious way of looking everywhere while they
      chattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the sisters arrived here, a monotonous boy in a Scotch cap put his
      head round a beam on the left, and said, ‘Less noise there, ladies!’ and
      disappeared. Immediately after which, a sprightly gentleman with a
      quantity of long black hair looked round a beam on the right, and said,
      ‘Less noise there, darlings!’ and also disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The notion of you among professionals, Amy, is really the last thing I
      could have conceived!’ said her sister. ‘Why, how did you ever get here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know. The lady who told you I was here, was so good as to bring
      me in.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Like you quiet little things! You can make your way anywhere, I believe.
      <i>I</i> couldn’t have managed it, Amy, though I know so much more of the
      world.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the family custom to lay it down as family law, that she was a
      plain domestic little creature, without the great and sage experience of
      the rest. This family fiction was the family assertion of itself against
      her services. Not to make too much of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well! And what have you got on your mind, Amy? Of course you have got
      something on your mind about me?’ said Fanny. She spoke as if her sister,
      between two and three years her junior, were her prejudiced grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is not much; but since you told me of the lady who gave you the
      bracelet, Fanny—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monotonous boy put his head round the beam on the left, and said,
      ‘Look out there, ladies!’ and disappeared. The sprightly gentleman with
      the black hair as suddenly put his head round the beam on the right, and
      said, ‘Look out there, darlings!’ and also disappeared. Thereupon all the
      young ladies rose and began shaking their skirts out behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Amy?’ said Fanny, doing as the rest did; ‘what were you going to
      say?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Since you told me a lady had given you the bracelet you showed me, Fanny,
      I have not been quite easy on your account, and indeed want to know a
      little more if you will confide more to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, ladies!’ said the boy in the Scotch cap. ‘Now, darlings!’ said the
      gentleman with the black hair. They were every one gone in a moment, and
      the music and the dancing feet were heard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit sat down in a golden chair, made quite giddy by these rapid
      interruptions. Her sister and the rest were a long time gone; and during
      their absence a voice (it appeared to be that of the gentleman with the
      black hair) was continually calling out through the music, ‘One, two,
      three, four, five, six—go! One, two, three, four, five, six—go!
      Steady, darlings! One, two, three, four, five, six—go!’ Ultimately
      the voice stopped, and they all came back again, more or less out of
      breath, folding themselves in their shawls, and making ready for the
      streets. ‘Stop a moment, Amy, and let them get away before us,’ whispered
      Fanny. They were soon left alone; nothing more important happening, in the
      meantime, than the boy looking round his old beam, and saying, ‘Everybody
      at eleven to-morrow, ladies!’ and the gentleman with the black hair
      looking round his old beam, and saying, ‘Everybody at eleven to-morrow,
      darlings!’ each in his own accustomed manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were alone, something was rolled up or by other means got out of
      the way, and there was a great empty well before them, looking down into
      the depths of which Fanny said, ‘Now, uncle!’ Little Dorrit, as her eyes
      became used to the darkness, faintly made him out at the bottom of the
      well, in an obscure corner by himself, with his instrument in its ragged
      case under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked as if the remote high gallery windows, with their
      little strip of sky, might have been the point of his better fortunes,
      from which he had descended, until he had gradually sunk down below there
      to the bottom. He had been in that place six nights a week for many years,
      but had never been observed to raise his eyes above his music-book, and
      was confidently believed to have never seen a play. There were legends in
      the place that he did not so much as know the popular heroes and heroines
      by sight, and that the low comedian had ‘mugged’ at him in his richest
      manner fifty nights for a wager, and he had shown no trace of
      consciousness. The carpenters had a joke to the effect that he was dead
      without being aware of it; and the frequenters of the pit supposed him to
      pass his whole life, night and day, and Sunday and all, in the orchestra.
      They had tried him a few times with pinches of snuff offered over the
      rails, and he had always responded to this attention with a momentary
      waking up of manner that had the pale phantom of a gentleman in it: beyond
      this he never, on any occasion, had any other part in what was going on
      than the part written out for the clarionet; in private life, where there
      was no part for the clarionet, he had no part at all. Some said he was
      poor, some said he was a wealthy miser; but he said nothing, never lifted
      up his bowed head, never varied his shuffling gait by getting his
      springless foot from the ground. Though expecting now to be summoned by
      his niece, he did not hear her until she had spoken to him three or four
      times; nor was he at all surprised by the presence of two nieces instead
      of one, but merely said in his tremulous voice, ‘I am coming, I am
      coming!’ and crept forth by some underground way which emitted a cellarous
      smell.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And so, Amy,’ said her sister, when the three together passed out at the
      door that had such a shame-faced consciousness of being different from
      other doors: the uncle instinctively taking Amy’s arm as the arm to be
      relied on: ‘so, Amy, you are curious about me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pretty, and conscious, and rather flaunting; and the condescension
      with which she put aside the superiority of her charms, and of her worldly
      experience, and addressed her sister on almost equal terms, had a vast
      deal of the family in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am interested, Fanny, and concerned in anything that concerns you.’

      ‘So you are, so you are, and you are the best of Amys. If I am ever a
      little provoking, I am sure you’ll consider what a thing it is to occupy
      my position and feel a consciousness of being superior to it. I shouldn’t
      care,’ said the Daughter of the Father of the Marshalsea, ‘if the others
      were not so common. None of them have come down in the world as we have.
      They are all on their own level. Common.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit mildly looked at the speaker, but did not interrupt her.
      Fanny took out her handkerchief, and rather angrily wiped her eyes. ‘I was
      not born where you were, you know, Amy, and perhaps that makes a
      difference. My dear child, when we get rid of Uncle, you shall know all
      about it. We’ll drop him at the cook’s shop where he is going to dine.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on with him until they came to a dirty shop window in a dirty
      street, which was made almost opaque by the steam of hot meats,
      vegetables, and puddings. But glimpses were to be caught of a roast leg of
      pork bursting into tears of sage and onion in a metal reservoir full of
      gravy, of an unctuous piece of roast beef and blisterous Yorkshire
      pudding, bubbling hot in a similar receptacle, of a stuffed fillet of veal
      in rapid cut, of a ham in a perspiration with the pace it was going at, of
      a shallow tank of baked potatoes glued together by their own richness, of
      a truss or two of boiled greens, and other substantial delicacies. Within,
      were a few wooden partitions, behind which such customers as found it more
      convenient to take away their dinners in stomachs than in their hands,
      Packed their purchases in solitude. Fanny opening her reticule, as they
      surveyed these things, produced from that repository a shilling and handed
      it to Uncle. Uncle, after not looking at it a little while, divined its
      object, and muttering ‘Dinner? Ha! Yes, yes, yes!’ slowly vanished from
      them into the mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, Amy,’ said her sister, ‘come with me, if you are not too tired to
      walk to Harley Street, Cavendish Square.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The air with which she threw off this distinguished address and the toss
      she gave to her new bonnet (which was more gauzy than serviceable), made
      her sister wonder; however, she expressed her readiness to go to Harley
      Street, and thither they directed their steps. Arrived at that grand
      destination, Fanny singled out the handsomest house, and knocking at the
      door, inquired for Mrs Merdle. The footman who opened the door, although
      he had powder on his head and was backed up by two other footmen likewise
      powdered, not only admitted Mrs Merdle to be at home, but asked Fanny to
      walk in. Fanny walked in, taking her sister with her; and they went
      up-stairs with powder going before and powder stopping behind, and were
      left in a spacious semicircular drawing-room, one of several
      drawing-rooms, where there was a parrot on the outside of a golden cage
      holding on by its beak, with its scaly legs in the air, and putting itself
      into many strange upside-down postures. This peculiarity has been observed
      in birds of quite another feather, climbing upon golden wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was far more splendid than anything Little Dorrit had ever
      imagined, and would have been splendid and costly in any eyes. She looked
      in amazement at her sister and would have asked a question, but that Fanny
      with a warning frown pointed to a curtained doorway of communication with
      another room. The curtain shook next moment, and a lady, raising it with a
      heavily ringed hand, dropped it behind her again as she entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was not young and fresh from the hand of Nature, but was young
      and fresh from the hand of her maid. She had large unfeeling handsome
      eyes, and dark unfeeling handsome hair, and a broad unfeeling handsome
      bosom, and was made the most of in every particular. Either because she
      had a cold, or because it suited her face, she wore a rich white fillet
      tied over her head and under her chin. And if ever there were an unfeeling
      handsome chin that looked as if, for certain, it had never been, in
      familiar parlance, ‘chucked’ by the hand of man, it was the chin curbed up
      so tight and close by that laced bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Merdle,’ said Fanny. ‘My sister, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am glad to see your sister, Miss Dorrit. I did not remember that you
      had a sister.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I did not mention that I had,’ said Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah!’ Mrs Merdle curled the little finger of her left hand as who should
      say, ‘I have caught you. I know you didn’t!’ All her action was usually
      with her left hand because her hands were not a pair; and left being much
      the whiter and plumper of the two. Then she added: ‘Sit down,’ and
      composed herself voluptuously, in a nest of crimson and gold cushions, on
      an ottoman near the parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Also professional?’ said Mrs Merdle, looking at Little Dorrit through an
      eye-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny answered No. ‘No,’ said Mrs Merdle, dropping her glass. ‘Has not a
      professional air. Very pleasant; but not professional.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My sister, ma’am,’ said Fanny, in whom there was a singular mixture of
      deference and hardihood, ‘has been asking me to tell her, as between
      sisters, how I came to have the honour of knowing you. And as I had
      engaged to call upon you once more, I thought I might take the liberty of
      bringing her with me, when perhaps you would tell her. I wish her to know,
      and perhaps you will tell her?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you think, at your sister’s age—’ hinted Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She is much older than she looks,’ said Fanny; ‘almost as old as I am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Society,’ said Mrs Merdle, with another curve of her little finger, ‘is
      so difficult to explain to young persons (indeed is so difficult to
      explain to most persons), that I am glad to hear that. I wish Society was
      not so arbitrary, I wish it was not so exacting—Bird, be quiet!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The parrot had given a most piercing shriek, as if its name were Society
      and it asserted its right to its exactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But,’ resumed Mrs Merdle, ‘we must take it as we find it. We know it is
      hollow and conventional and worldly and very shocking, but unless we are
      Savages in the Tropical seas (I should have been charmed to be one myself—most
      delightful life and perfect climate, I am told), we must consult it. It is
      the common lot. Mr Merdle is a most extensive merchant, his transactions
      are on the vastest scale, his wealth and influence are very great, but
      even he—Bird, be quiet!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The parrot had shrieked another shriek; and it filled up the sentence so
      expressively that Mrs Merdle was under no necessity to end it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Since your sister begs that I would terminate our personal acquaintance,’ 
      she began again, addressing Little Dorrit, ‘by relating the circumstances
      that are much to her credit, I cannot object to comply with her request, I
      am sure. I have a son (I was first married extremely young) of two or
      three-and-twenty.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny set her lips, and her eyes looked half triumphantly at her sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A son of two or three-and-twenty. He is a little gay, a thing Society is
      accustomed to in young men, and he is very impressible. Perhaps he
      inherits that misfortune. I am very impressible myself, by nature. The
      weakest of creatures—my feelings are touched in a moment.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She said all this, and everything else, as coldly as a woman of snow;
      quite forgetting the sisters except at odd times, and apparently
      addressing some abstraction of Society; for whose behoof, too, she
      occasionally arranged her dress, or the composition of her figure upon the
      ottoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So he is very impressible. Not a misfortune in our natural state I dare
      say, but we are not in a natural state. Much to be lamented, no doubt,
      particularly by myself, who am a child of nature if I could but show it;
      but so it is. Society suppresses us and dominates us—Bird, be
      quiet!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The parrot had broken into a violent fit of laughter, after twisting
      divers bars of his cage with his crooked bill, and licking them with his
      black tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is quite unnecessary to say to a person of your good sense, wide range
      of experience, and cultivated feeling,’ said Mrs Merdle from her nest of
      crimson and gold—and there put up her glass to refresh her memory as
      to whom she was addressing,—‘that the stage sometimes has a
      fascination for young men of that class of character. In saying the stage,
      I mean the people on it of the female sex. Therefore, when I heard that my
      son was supposed to be fascinated by a dancer, I knew what that usually
      meant in Society, and confided in her being a dancer at the Opera, where
      young men moving in Society are usually fascinated.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed her white hands over one another, observant of the sisters now;
      and the rings upon her fingers grated against each other with a hard
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As your sister will tell you, when I found what the theatre was I was
      much surprised and much distressed. But when I found that your sister, by
      rejecting my son’s advances (I must add, in an unexpected manner), had
      brought him to the point of proposing marriage, my feelings were of the
      profoundest anguish—acute.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She traced the outline of her left eyebrow, and put it right.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In a distracted condition, which only a mother—moving in Society—can
      be susceptible of, I determined to go myself to the theatre, and represent
      my state of mind to the dancer. I made myself known to your sister. I
      found her, to my surprise, in many respects different from my
      expectations; and certainly in none more so, than in meeting me with—what
      shall I say—a sort of family assertion on her own part?’ Mrs Merdle
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I told you, ma’am,’ said Fanny, with a heightening colour, ‘that although
      you found me in that situation, I was so far above the rest, that I
      considered my family as good as your son’s; and that I had a brother who,
      knowing the circumstances, would be of the same opinion, and would not
      consider such a connection any honour.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Dorrit,’ said Mrs Merdle, after frostily looking at her through her
      glass, ‘precisely what I was on the point of telling your sister, in
      pursuance of your request. Much obliged to you for recalling it so
      accurately and anticipating me. I immediately,’ addressing Little Dorrit,
      ‘(for I am the creature of impulse), took a bracelet from my arm, and
      begged your sister to let me clasp it on hers, in token of the delight I
      had in our being able to approach the subject so far on a common footing.’ 
      (This was perfectly true, the lady having bought a cheap and showy article
      on her way to the interview, with a general eye to bribery.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I told you, Mrs Merdle,’ said Fanny, ‘that we might be unfortunate,
      but we are not common.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think, the very words, Miss Dorrit,’ assented Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I told you, Mrs Merdle,’ said Fanny, ‘that if you spoke to me of the
      superiority of your son’s standing in Society, it was barely possible that
      you rather deceived yourself in your suppositions about my origin; and
      that my father’s standing, even in the Society in which he now moved (what
      that was, was best known to myself), was eminently superior, and was
      acknowledged by every one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite accurate,’ rejoined Mrs Merdle. ‘A most admirable memory.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, ma’am. Perhaps you will be so kind as to tell my sister the
      rest.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There is very little to tell,’ said Mrs Merdle, reviewing the breadth of
      bosom which seemed essential to her having room enough to be unfeeling in,
      ‘but it is to your sister’s credit. I pointed out to your sister the plain
      state of the case; the impossibility of the Society in which we moved
      recognising the Society in which she moved—though charming, I have
      no doubt; the immense disadvantage at which she would consequently place
      the family she had so high an opinion of, upon which we should find
      ourselves compelled to look down with contempt, and from which (socially
      speaking) we should feel obliged to recoil with abhorrence. In short, I
      made an appeal to that laudable pride in your sister.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let my sister know, if you please, Mrs Merdle,’ Fanny pouted, with a toss
      of her gauzy bonnet, ‘that I had already had the honour of telling your
      son that I wished to have nothing whatever to say to him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, Miss Dorrit,’ assented Mrs Merdle, ‘perhaps I might have mentioned
      that before. If I did not think of it, perhaps it was because my mind
      reverted to the apprehensions I had at the time that he might persevere
      and you might have something to say to him. I also mentioned to your
      sister—I again address the non-professional Miss Dorrit—that
      my son would have nothing in the event of such a marriage, and would be an
      absolute beggar. (I mention that merely as a fact which is part of the
      narrative, and not as supposing it to have influenced your sister, except
      in the prudent and legitimate way in which, constituted as our artificial
      system is, we must all be influenced by such considerations.) Finally,
      after some high words and high spirit on the part of your sister, we came
      to the complete understanding that there was no danger; and your sister
      was so obliging as to allow me to present her with a mark or two of my
      appreciation at my dressmaker’s.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit looked sorry, and glanced at Fanny with a troubled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Also,’ said Mrs Merdle, ‘as to promise to give me the present pleasure of
      a closing interview, and of parting with her on the best of terms. On
      which occasion,’ added Mrs Merdle, quitting her nest, and putting
      something in Fanny’s hand, ‘Miss Dorrit will permit me to say Farewell
      with best wishes in my own dull manner.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sisters rose at the same time, and they all stood near the cage of the
      parrot, as he tore at a claw-full of biscuit and spat it out, seemed to
      mock them with a pompous dance of his body without moving his feet, and
      suddenly turned himself upside down and trailed himself all over the
      outside of his golden cage, with the aid of his cruel beak and black
      tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Adieu, Miss Dorrit, with best wishes,’ said Mrs Merdle. ‘If we could only
      come to a Millennium, or something of that sort, I for one might have the
      pleasure of knowing a number of charming and talented persons from whom I
      am at present excluded. A more primitive state of society would be
      delicious to me. There used to be a poem when I learnt lessons, something
      about Lo the poor Indians whose something mind! If a few thousand persons
      moving in Society, could only go and be Indians, I would put my name down
      directly; but as, moving in Society, we can’t be Indians, unfortunately—Good
      morning!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They came down-stairs with powder before them and powder behind, the elder
      sister haughty and the younger sister humbled, and were shut out into
      unpowdered Harley Street, Cavendish Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ said Fanny, when they had gone a little way without speaking.
      ‘Have you nothing to say, Amy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, I don’t know what to say!’ she answered, distressed. ‘You didn’t like
      this young man, Fanny?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Like him? He is almost an idiot.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am so sorry—don’t be hurt—but, since you ask me what I have
      to say, I am so very sorry, Fanny, that you suffered this lady to give you
      anything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You little Fool!’ returned her sister, shaking her with the sharp pull
      she gave her arm. ‘Have you no spirit at all? But that’s just the way! You
      have no self-respect, you have no becoming pride, just as you allow
      yourself to be followed about by a contemptible little Chivery of a
      thing,’ with the scornfullest emphasis, ‘you would let your family be
      trodden on, and never turn.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t say that, dear Fanny. I do what I can for them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You do what you can for them!’ repeated Fanny, walking her on very fast.
      ‘Would you let a woman like this, whom you could see, if you had any
      experience of anything, to be as false and insolent as a woman can be—would
      you let her put her foot upon your family, and thank her for it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, Fanny, I am sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then make her pay for it, you mean little thing. What else can you make
      her do? Make her pay for it, you stupid child; and do your family some
      credit with the money!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke no more all the way back to the lodging where Fanny and her
      uncle lived. When they arrived there, they found the old man practising
      his clarionet in the dolefullest manner in a corner of the room. Fanny had
      a composite meal to make, of chops, and porter, and tea; and indignantly
      pretended to prepare it for herself, though her sister did all that in
      quiet reality. When at last Fanny sat down to eat and drink, she threw the
      table implements about and was angry with her bread, much as her father
      had been last night.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you despise me,’ she said, bursting into vehement tears, ‘because I am
      a dancer, why did you put me in the way of being one? It was your doing.
      You would have me stoop as low as the ground before this Mrs Merdle, and
      let her say what she liked and do what she liked, and hold us all in
      contempt, and tell me so to my face. Because I am a dancer!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O Fanny!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And Tip, too, poor fellow. She is to disparage him just as much as she
      likes, without any check—I suppose because he has been in the law,
      and the docks, and different things. Why, it was your doing, Amy. You
      might at least approve of his being defended.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the uncle was dolefully blowing his clarionet in the corner,
      sometimes taking it an inch or so from his mouth for a moment while he
      stopped to gaze at them, with a vague impression that somebody had said
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And your father, your poor father, Amy. Because he is not free to show
      himself and to speak for himself, you would let such people insult him
      with impunity. If you don’t feel for yourself because you go out to work,
      you might at least feel for him, I should think, knowing what he has
      undergone so long.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Little Dorrit felt the injustice of this taunt rather sharply. The
      remembrance of last night added a barbed point to it. She said nothing in
      reply, but turned her chair from the table towards the fire. Uncle, after
      making one more pause, blew a dismal wail and went on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny was passionate with the tea-cups and the bread as long as her
      passion lasted, and then protested that she was the wretchedest girl in
      the world, and she wished she was dead. After that, her crying became
      remorseful, and she got up and put her arms round her sister. Little
      Dorrit tried to stop her from saying anything, but she answered that she
      would, she must! Thereupon she said again, and again, ‘I beg your pardon,
      Amy,’ and ‘Forgive me, Amy,’ almost as passionately as she had said what
      she regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But indeed, indeed, Amy,’ she resumed when they were seated in sisterly
      accord side by side, ‘I hope and I think you would have seen this
      differently, if you had known a little more of Society.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps I might, Fanny,’ said the mild Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You see, while you have been domestic and resignedly shut up there, Amy,’ 
      pursued her sister, gradually beginning to patronise, ‘I have been out,
      moving more in Society, and may have been getting proud and spirited—more
      than I ought to be, perhaps?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit answered ‘Yes. O yes!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And while you have been thinking of the dinner or the clothes, I may have
      been thinking, you know, of the family. Now, may it not be so, Amy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit again nodded ‘Yes,’ with a more cheerful face than heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Especially as we know,’ said Fanny, ‘that there certainly is a tone in
      the place to which you have been so true, which does belong to it, and
      which does make it different from other aspects of Society. So kiss me
      once again, Amy dear, and we will agree that we may both be right, and
      that you are a tranquil, domestic, home-loving, good girl.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clarionet had been lamenting most pathetically during this dialogue,
      but was cut short now by Fanny’s announcement that it was time to go;
      which she conveyed to her uncle by shutting up his scrap of music, and
      taking the clarionet out of his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit parted from them at the door, and hastened back to the
      Marshalsea. It fell dark there sooner than elsewhere, and going into it
      that evening was like going into a deep trench. The shadow of the wall was
      on every object. Not least upon the figure in the old grey gown and the
      black velvet cap, as it turned towards her when she opened the door of the
      dim room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why not upon me too!’ thought Little Dorrit, with the door yet in her
      hand. ‘It was not unreasonable in Fanny.’

	</hgroup>
<p>Upon that establishment of state, the Merdle establishment in Harley
      Street, Cavendish Square, there was the shadow of no more common wall than
      the fronts of other establishments of state on the opposite side of the
      street. Like unexceptionable Society, the opposing rows of houses in
      Harley Street were very grim with one another. Indeed, the mansions and
      their inhabitants were so much alike in that respect, that the people were
      often to be found drawn up on opposite sides of dinner-tables, in the
      shade of their own loftiness, staring at the other side of the way with
      the dullness of the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows how like the street the two dinner-rows of people who take
      their stand by the street will be. The expressionless uniform twenty
      houses, all to be knocked at and rung at in the same form, all
      approachable by the same dull steps, all fended off by the same pattern of
      railing, all with the same impracticable fire-escapes, the same
      inconvenient fixtures in their heads, and everything without exception to
      be taken at a high valuation—who has not dined with these? The house
      so drearily out of repair, the occasional bow-window, the stuccoed house,
      the newly-fronted house, the corner house with nothing but angular rooms,
      the house with the blinds always down, the house with the hatchment always
      up, the house where the collector has called for one quarter of an Idea,
      and found nobody at home—who has not dined with these? The house
      that nobody will take, and is to be had a bargain—who does not know
      her? The showy house that was taken for life by the disappointed
      gentleman, and which does not suit him at all—who is unacquainted
      with that haunted habitation?
    </p>
    <p>
      Harley Street, Cavendish Square, was more than aware of Mr and Mrs Merdle.
      Intruders there were in Harley Street, of whom it was not aware; but Mr
      and Mrs Merdle it delighted to honour. Society was aware of Mr and Mrs
      Merdle. Society had said ‘Let us license them; let us know them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle was immensely rich; a man of prodigious enterprise; a Midas
      without the ears, who turned all he touched to gold. He was in everything
      good, from banking to building. He was in Parliament, of course. He was in
      the City, necessarily. He was Chairman of this, Trustee of that, President
      of the other. The weightiest of men had said to projectors, ‘Now, what
      name have you got? Have you got Merdle?’ And, the reply being in the
      negative, had said, ‘Then I won’t look at you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This great and fortunate man had provided that extensive bosom which
      required so much room to be unfeeling enough in, with a nest of crimson
      and gold some fifteen years before. It was not a bosom to repose upon, but
      it was a capital bosom to hang jewels upon. Mr Merdle wanted something to
      hang jewels upon, and he bought it for the purpose. Storr and Mortimer
      might have married on the same speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all his other speculations, it was sound and successful. The jewels
      showed to the richest advantage. The bosom moving in Society with the
      jewels displayed upon it, attracted general admiration. Society approving,
      Mr Merdle was satisfied. He was the most disinterested of men,—did
      everything for Society, and got as little for himself out of all his gain
      and care, as a man might.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is to say, it may be supposed that he got all he wanted, otherwise
      with unlimited wealth he would have got it. But his desire was to the
      utmost to satisfy Society (whatever that was), and take up all its drafts
      upon him for tribute. He did not shine in company; he had not very much to
      say for himself; he was a reserved man, with a broad, overhanging,
      watchful head, that particular kind of dull red colour in his cheeks which
      is rather stale than fresh, and a somewhat uneasy expression about his
      coat-cuffs, as if they were in his confidence, and had reasons for being
      anxious to hide his hands. In the little he said, he was a pleasant man
      enough; plain, emphatic about public and private confidence, and tenacious
      of the utmost deference being shown by every one, in all things, to
      Society. In this same Society (if that were it which came to his dinners,
      and to Mrs Merdle’s receptions and concerts), he hardly seemed to enjoy
      himself much, and was mostly to be found against walls and behind doors.
      Also when he went out to it, instead of its coming home to him, he seemed
      a little fatigued, and upon the whole rather more disposed for bed; but he
      was always cultivating it nevertheless, and always moving in it—and
      always laying out money on it with the greatest liberality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle’s first husband had been a colonel, under whose auspices the
      bosom had entered into competition with the snows of North America, and
      had come off at little disadvantage in point of whiteness, and at none in
      point of coldness. The colonel’s son was Mrs Merdle’s only child. He was
      of a chuckle-headed, high-shouldered make, with a general appearance of
      being, not so much a young man as a swelled boy. He had given so few signs
      of reason, that a by-word went among his companions that his brain had
      been frozen up in a mighty frost which prevailed at St John’s, New
      Brunswick, at the period of his birth there, and had never thawed from
      that hour. Another by-word represented him as having in his infancy,
      through the negligence of a nurse, fallen out of a high window on his
      head, which had been heard by responsible witnesses to crack. It is
      probable that both these representations were of ex post facto origin; the
      young gentleman (whose expressive name was Sparkler) being monomaniacal in
      offering marriage to all manner of undesirable young ladies, and in
      remarking of every successive young lady to whom he tendered a matrimonial
      proposal that she was ‘a doosed fine gal—well educated too—with
      no biggodd nonsense about her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A son-in-law with these limited talents, might have been a clog upon
      another man; but Mr Merdle did not want a son-in-law for himself; he
      wanted a son-in-law for Society. Mr Sparkler having been in the Guards,
      and being in the habit of frequenting all the races, and all the lounges,
      and all the parties, and being well known, Society was satisfied with its
      son-in-law. This happy result Mr Merdle would have considered well
      attained, though Mr Sparkler had been a more expensive article. And he did
      not get Mr Sparkler by any means cheap for Society, even as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dinner giving in the Harley Street establishment, while Little
      Dorrit was stitching at her father’s new shirts by his side that night;
      and there were magnates from the Court and magnates from the City,
      magnates from the Commons and magnates from the Lords, magnates from the
      bench and magnates from the bar, Bishop magnates, Treasury magnates, Horse
      Guard magnates, Admiralty magnates,—all the magnates that keep us
      going, and sometimes trip us up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am told,’ said Bishop magnate to Horse Guards, ‘that Mr Merdle has made
      another enormous hit. They say a hundred thousand pounds.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Horse Guards had heard two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasury had heard three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bar, handling his persuasive double eye-glass, was by no means clear but
      that it might be four. It was one of those happy strokes of calculation
      and combination, the result of which it was difficult to estimate. It was
      one of those instances of a comprehensive grasp, associated with habitual
      luck and characteristic boldness, of which an age presented us but few.
      But here was Brother Bellows, who had been in the great Bank case, and who
      could probably tell us more. What did Brother Bellows put this new success
      at?
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Bellows was on his way to make his bow to the bosom, and could
      only tell them in passing that he had heard it stated, with great
      appearance of truth, as being worth, from first to last, half-a-million of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiralty said Mr Merdle was a wonderful man, Treasury said he was a new
      power in the country, and would be able to buy up the whole House of
      Commons. Bishop said he was glad to think that this wealth flowed into the
      coffers of a gentleman who was always disposed to maintain the best
      interests of Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle himself was usually late on these occasions, as a man still
      detained in the clutch of giant enterprises when other men had shaken off
      their dwarfs for the day. On this occasion, he was the last arrival.
      Treasury said Merdle’s work punished him a little. Bishop said he was glad
      to think that this wealth flowed into the coffers of a gentleman who
      accepted it with meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Powder! There was so much Powder in waiting, that it flavoured the dinner.
      Pulverous particles got into the dishes, and Society’s meats had a
      seasoning of first-rate footmen. Mr Merdle took down a countess who was
      secluded somewhere in the core of an immense dress, to which she was in
      the proportion of the heart to the overgrown cabbage. If so low a simile
      may be admitted, the dress went down the staircase like a richly brocaded
      Jack in the Green, and nobody knew what sort of small person carried it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society had everything it could want, and could not want, for dinner. It
      had everything to look at, and everything to eat, and everything to drink.
      It is to be hoped it enjoyed itself; for Mr Merdle’s own share of the
      repast might have been paid for with eighteenpence. Mrs Merdle was
      magnificent. The chief butler was the next magnificent institution of the
      day. He was the stateliest man in the company. He did nothing, but he
      looked on as few other men could have done. He was Mr Merdle’s last gift
      to Society. Mr Merdle didn’t want him, and was put out of countenance when
      the great creature looked at him; but inappeasable Society would have him—and
      had got him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invisible countess carried out the Green at the usual stage of the
      entertainment, and the file of beauty was closed up by the bosom. Treasury
      said, Juno. Bishop said, Judith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bar fell into discussion with Horse Guards concerning courts-martial.
      Brothers Bellows and Bench struck in. Other magnates paired off. Mr Merdle
      sat silent, and looked at the table-cloth. Sometimes a magnate addressed
      him, to turn the stream of his own particular discussion towards him; but
      Mr Merdle seldom gave much attention to it, or did more than rouse himself
      from his calculations and pass the wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they rose, so many of the magnates had something to say to Mr Merdle
      individually that he held little levees by the sideboard, and checked them
      off as they went out at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treasury hoped he might venture to congratulate one of England’s
      world-famed capitalists and merchant-princes (he had turned that original
      sentiment in the house a few times, and it came easy to him) on a new
      achievement. To extend the triumphs of such men was to extend the triumphs
      and resources of the nation; and Treasury felt—he gave Mr Merdle to
      understand—patriotic on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, my lord,’ said Mr Merdle; ‘thank you. I accept your
      congratulations with pride, and I am glad you approve.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, I don’t unreservedly approve, my dear Mr Merdle. Because,’ smiling
      Treasury turned him by the arm towards the sideboard and spoke
      banteringly, ‘it never can be worth your while to come among us and help
      us.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle felt honoured by the—
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no,’ said Treasury, ‘that is not the light in which one so
      distinguished for practical knowledge and great foresight, can be expected
      to regard it. If we should ever be happily enabled, by accidentally
      possessing the control over circumstances, to propose to one so eminent to—to
      come among us, and give us the weight of his influence, knowledge, and
      character, we could only propose it to him as a duty. In fact, as a duty
      that he owed to Society.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle intimated that Society was the apple of his eye, and that its
      claims were paramount to every other consideration. Treasury moved on, and
      Bar came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bar, with his little insinuating jury droop, and fingering his persuasive
      double eye-glass, hoped he might be excused if he mentioned to one of the
      greatest converters of the root of all evil into the root of all good, who
      had for a long time reflected a shining lustre on the annals even of our
      commercial country—if he mentioned, disinterestedly, and as, what we
      lawyers called in our pedantic way, amicus curiae, a fact that had come by
      accident within his knowledge. He had been required to look over the title
      of a very considerable estate in one of the eastern counties—lying,
      in fact, for Mr Merdle knew we lawyers loved to be particular, on the
      borders of two of the eastern counties. Now, the title was perfectly
      sound, and the estate was to be purchased by one who had the command of—Money
      (jury droop and persuasive eye-glass), on remarkably advantageous terms.
      This had come to Bar’s knowledge only that day, and it had occurred to
      him, ‘I shall have the honour of dining with my esteemed friend Mr Merdle
      this evening, and, strictly between ourselves, I will mention the
      opportunity.’ Such a purchase would involve not only a great legitimate
      political influence, but some half-dozen church presentations of
      considerable annual value. Now, that Mr Merdle was already at no loss to
      discover means of occupying even his capital, and of fully employing even
      his active and vigorous intellect, Bar well knew: but he would venture to
      suggest that the question arose in his mind, whether one who had
      deservedly gained so high a position and so European a reputation did not
      owe it—we would not say to himself, but we would say to Society, to
      possess himself of such influences as these; and to exercise them—we
      would not say for his own, or for his party’s, but we would say for
      Society’s—benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle again expressed himself as wholly devoted to that object of his
      constant consideration, and Bar took his persuasive eye-glass up the grand
      staircase. Bishop then came undesignedly sidling in the direction of the
      sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely the goods of this world, it occurred in an accidental way to Bishop
      to remark, could scarcely be directed into happier channels than when they
      accumulated under the magic touch of the wise and sagacious, who, while
      they knew the just value of riches (Bishop tried here to look as if he
      were rather poor himself), were aware of their importance, judiciously
      governed and rightly distributed, to the welfare of our brethren at large.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle with humility expressed his conviction that Bishop couldn’t mean
      him, and with inconsistency expressed his high gratification in Bishop’s
      good opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop then—jauntily stepping out a little with his well-shaped
      right leg, as though he said to Mr Merdle ‘don’t mind the apron; a mere
      form!’ put this case to his good friend:
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether it had occurred to his good friend, that Society might not
      unreasonably hope that one so blest in his undertakings, and whose example
      on his pedestal was so influential with it, would shed a little money in
      the direction of a mission or so to Africa?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle signifying that the idea should have his best attention, Bishop
      put another case:
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether his good friend had at all interested himself in the proceedings
      of our Combined Additional Endowed Dignitaries Committee, and whether it
      had occurred to him that to shed a little money in <i>that</i> direction
      might be a great conception finely executed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle made a similar reply, and Bishop explained his reason for
      inquiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Society looked to such men as his good friend to do such things. It was
      not that <i>he</i> looked to them, but that Society looked to them. Just
      as it was not Our Committee who wanted the Additional Endowed Dignitaries,
      but it was Society that was in a state of the most agonising uneasiness of
      mind until it got them. He begged to assure his good friend that he was
      extremely sensible of his good friend’s regard on all occasions for the
      best interests of Society; and he considered that he was at once
      consulting those interests and expressing the feeling of Society, when he
      wished him continued prosperity, continued increase of riches, and
      continued things in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bishop then betook himself up-stairs, and the other magnates gradually
      floated up after him until there was no one left below but Mr Merdle. That
      gentleman, after looking at the table-cloth until the soul of the chief
      butler glowed with a noble resentment, went slowly up after the rest, and
      became of no account in the stream of people on the grand staircase. Mrs
      Merdle was at home, the best of the jewels were hung out to be seen,
      Society got what it came for, Mr Merdle drank twopennyworth of tea in a
      corner and got more than he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the evening magnates was a famous physician, who knew everybody, and
      whom everybody knew. On entering at the door, he came upon Mr Merdle
      drinking his tea in a corner, and touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle started. ‘Oh! It’s you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Any better to-day?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Mr Merdle, ‘I am no better.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A pity I didn’t see you this morning. Pray come to me to-morrow, or let
      me come to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ he replied. ‘I will come to-morrow as I drive by.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bar and Bishop had both been bystanders during this short dialogue, and as
      Mr Merdle was swept away by the crowd, they made their remarks upon it to
      the Physician. Bar said, there was a certain point of mental strain beyond
      which no man could go; that the point varied with various textures of
      brain and peculiarities of constitution, as he had had occasion to notice
      in several of his learned brothers; but the point of endurance passed by a
      line’s breadth, depression and dyspepsia ensued. Not to intrude on the
      sacred mysteries of medicine, he took it, now (with the jury droop and
      persuasive eye-glass), that this was Merdle’s case? Bishop said that when
      he was a young man, and had fallen for a brief space into the habit of
      writing sermons on Saturdays, a habit which all young sons of the church
      should sedulously avoid, he had frequently been sensible of a depression,
      arising as he supposed from an over-taxed intellect, upon which the yolk
      of a new-laid egg, beaten up by the good woman in whose house he at that
      time lodged, with a glass of sound sherry, nutmeg, and powdered sugar
      acted like a charm. Without presuming to offer so simple a remedy to the
      consideration of so profound a professor of the great healing art, he
      would venture to inquire whether the strain, being by way of intricate
      calculations, the spirits might not (humanly speaking) be restored to
      their tone by a gentle and yet generous stimulant?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,’ said the physician, ‘yes, you are both right. But I may as well
      tell you that I can find nothing the matter with Mr Merdle. He has the
      constitution of a rhinoceros, the digestion of an ostrich, and the
      concentration of an oyster. As to nerves, Mr Merdle is of a cool
      temperament, and not a sensitive man: is about as invulnerable, I should
      say, as Achilles. How such a man should suppose himself unwell without
      reason, you may think strange. But I have found nothing the matter with
      him. He may have some deep-seated recondite complaint. I can’t say. I only
      say, that at present I have not found it out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint on the bosom now displaying
      precious stones in rivalry with many similar superb jewel-stands; there
      was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint on young Sparkler hovering about
      the rooms, monomaniacally seeking any sufficiently ineligible young lady
      with no nonsense about her; there was no shadow of Mr Merdle’s complaint
      on the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings, of whom whole colonies were present;
      or on any of the company. Even on himself, its shadow was faint enough as
      he moved about among the throng, receiving homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle’s complaint. Society and he had so much to do with one another
      in all things else, that it is hard to imagine his complaint, if he had
      one, being solely his own affair. Had he that deep-seated recondite
      complaint, and did any doctor find it out? Patience, in the meantime, the
      shadow of the Marshalsea wall was a real darkening influence, and could be
      seen on the Dorrit Family at any stage of the sun’s course.

<p>Mr Clennam did not increase in favour with the Father of the Marshalsea in
      the ratio of his increasing visits. His obtuseness on the great
      Testimonial question was not calculated to awaken admiration in the
      paternal breast, but had rather a tendency to give offence in that
      sensitive quarter, and to be regarded as a positive shortcoming in point
      of gentlemanly feeling. An impression of disappointment, occasioned by the
      discovery that Mr Clennam scarcely possessed that delicacy for which, in
      the confidence of his nature, he had been inclined to give him credit,
      began to darken the fatherly mind in connection with that gentleman. The
      father went so far as to say, in his private family circle, that he feared
      Mr Clennam was not a man of high instincts. He was happy, he observed, in
      his public capacity as leader and representative of the College, to
      receive Mr Clennam when he called to pay his respects; but he didn’t find
      that he got on with him personally. There appeared to be something (he
      didn’t know what it was) wanting in him. Howbeit, the father did not fail
      in any outward show of politeness, but, on the contrary, honoured him with
      much attention; perhaps cherishing the hope that, although not a man of a
      sufficiently brilliant and spontaneous turn of mind to repeat his former
      testimonial unsolicited, it might still be within the compass of his
      nature to bear the part of a responsive gentleman, in any correspondence
      that way tending.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the threefold capacity, of the gentleman from outside who had been
      accidentally locked in on the night of his first appearance, of the
      gentleman from outside who had inquired into the affairs of the Father of
      the Marshalsea with the stupendous idea of getting him out, and of the
      gentleman from outside who took an interest in the child of the
      Marshalsea, Clennam soon became a visitor of mark. He was not surprised by
      the attentions he received from Mr Chivery when that officer was on the
      lock, for he made little distinction between Mr Chivery’s politeness and
      that of the other turnkeys. It was on one particular afternoon that Mr
      Chivery surprised him all at once, and stood forth from his companions in
      bold relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Chivery, by some artful exercise of his power of clearing the Lodge,
      had contrived to rid it of all sauntering Collegians; so that Clennam,
      coming out of the prison, should find him on duty alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘(Private) I ask your pardon, sir,’ said Mr Chivery in a secret manner;
      ‘but which way might you be going?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am going over the Bridge.’ He saw in Mr Chivery, with some
      astonishment, quite an Allegory of Silence, as he stood with his key on
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘(Private) I ask your pardon again,’ said Mr Chivery, ‘but could you go
      round by Horsemonger Lane? Could you by any means find time to look in at
      that address?’ handing him a little card, printed for circulation among
      the connection of Chivery and Co., Tobacconists, Importers of pure
      Havannah Cigars, Bengal Cheroots, and fine-flavoured Cubas, Dealers in
      Fancy Snuffs, &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘(Private) It an’t tobacco business,’ said Mr Chivery. ‘The truth is, it’s
      my wife. She’s wishful to say a word to you, sir, upon a point respecting—yes,’ 
      said Mr Chivery, answering Clennam’s look of apprehension with a nod,
      ‘respecting <i>her</i>.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I will make a point of seeing your wife directly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir. Much obliged. It an’t above ten minutes out of your way.
      Please to ask for <i>Mrs</i> Chivery!’ These instructions, Mr Chivery, who
      had already let him out, cautiously called through a little slide in the
      outer door, which he could draw back from within for the inspection of
      visitors when it pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur Clennam, with the card in his hand, betook himself to the address
      set forth upon it, and speedily arrived there. It was a very small
      establishment, wherein a decent woman sat behind the counter working at
      her needle. Little jars of tobacco, little boxes of cigars, a little
      assortment of pipes, a little jar or two of snuff, and a little instrument
      like a shoeing horn for serving it out, composed the retail stock in
      trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur mentioned his name, and his having promised to call, on the
      solicitation of Mr Chivery. About something relating to Miss Dorrit, he
      believed. Mrs Chivery at once laid aside her work, rose up from her seat
      behind the counter, and deploringly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You may see him now,’ said she, ‘if you’ll condescend to take a peep.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these mysterious words, she preceded the visitor into a little
      parlour behind the shop, with a little window in it commanding a very
      little dull back-yard. In this yard a wash of sheets and table-cloths
      tried (in vain, for want of air) to get itself dried on a line or two; and
      among those flapping articles was sitting in a chair, like the last
      mariner left alive on the deck of a damp ship without the power of furling
      the sails, a little woe-begone young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Our John,’ said Mrs Chivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to be deficient in interest, Clennam asked what he might be doing
      there?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s the only change he takes,’ said Mrs Chivery, shaking her head
      afresh. ‘He won’t go out, even in the back-yard, when there’s no linen;
      but when there’s linen to keep the neighbours’ eyes off, he’ll sit there,
      hours. Hours he will. Says he feels as if it was groves!’ Mrs Chivery
      shook her head again, put her apron in a motherly way to her eyes, and
      reconducted her visitor into the regions of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Please to take a seat, sir,’ said Mrs Chivery. ‘Miss Dorrit is the matter
      with Our John, sir; he’s a breaking his heart for her, and I would wish to
      take the liberty to ask how it’s to be made good to his parents when
      bust?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Chivery, who was a comfortable-looking woman much respected about
      Horsemonger Lane for her feelings and her conversation, uttered this
      speech with fell composure, and immediately afterwards began again to
      shake her head and dry her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir,’ said she in continuation, ‘you are acquainted with the family, and
      have interested yourself with the family, and are influential with the
      family. If you can promote views calculated to make two young people
      happy, let me, for Our John’s sake, and for both their sakes, implore you
      so to do!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have been so habituated,’ returned Arthur, at a loss, ‘during the short
      time I have known her, to consider Little—I have been so habituated
      to consider Miss Dorrit in a light altogether removed from that in which
      you present her to me, that you quite take me by surprise. Does she know
      your son?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Brought up together, sir,’ said Mrs Chivery. ‘Played together.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does she know your son as her admirer?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! bless you, sir,’ said Mrs Chivery, with a sort of triumphant shiver,
      ‘she never could have seen him on a Sunday without knowing he was that.
      His cane alone would have told it long ago, if nothing else had. Young men
      like John don’t take to ivory hands a pinting, for nothing. How did I
      first know it myself? Similarly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps Miss Dorrit may not be so ready as you, you see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then she knows it, sir,’ said Mrs Chivery, ‘by word of mouth.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you sure?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir,’ said Mrs Chivery, ‘sure and certain as in this house I am. I see my
      son go out with my own eyes when in this house I was, and I see my son
      come in with my own eyes when in this house I was, and I know he done it!’ 
      Mrs Chivery derived a surprising force of emphasis from the foregoing
      circumstantiality and repetition.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I ask you how he came to fall into the desponding state which causes
      you so much uneasiness?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That,’ said Mrs Chivery, ‘took place on that same day when to this house
      I see that John with these eyes return. Never been himself in this house
      since. Never was like what he has been since, not from the hour when to
      this house seven year ago me and his father, as tenants by the quarter,
      came!’ An effect in the nature of an affidavit was gained from this speech
      by Mrs Chivery’s peculiar power of construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I venture to inquire what is your version of the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You may,’ said Mrs Chivery, ‘and I will give it to you in honour and in
      word as true as in this shop I stand. Our John has every one’s good word
      and every one’s good wish. He played with her as a child when in that yard
      a child she played. He has known her ever since. He went out upon the
      Sunday afternoon when in this very parlour he had dined, and met her, with
      appointment or without appointment; which, I do not pretend to say. He
      made his offer to her. Her brother and sister is high in their views, and
      against Our John. Her father is all for himself in his views and against
      sharing her with any one. Under which circumstances she has answered Our
      John, “No, John, I cannot have you, I cannot have any husband, it is not
      my intentions ever to become a wife, it is my intentions to be always a
      sacrifice, farewell, find another worthy of you, and forget me!” This is
      the way in which she is doomed to be a constant slave to them that are not
      worthy that a constant slave she unto them should be. This is the way in
      which Our John has come to find no pleasure but in taking cold among the
      linen, and in showing in that yard, as in that yard I have myself shown
      you, a broken-down ruin that goes home to his mother’s heart!’ Here the
      good woman pointed to the little window, whence her son might be seen
      sitting disconsolate in the tuneless groves; and again shook her head and
      wiped her eyes, and besought him, for the united sakes of both the young
      people, to exercise his influence towards the bright reversal of these
      dismal events.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so confident in her exposition of the case, and it was so
      undeniably founded on correct premises in so far as the relative positions
      of Little Dorrit and her family were concerned, that Clennam could not
      feel positive on the other side. He had come to attach to Little Dorrit an
      interest so peculiar—an interest that removed her from, while it
      grew out of, the common and coarse things surrounding her—that he
      found it disappointing, disagreeable, almost painful, to suppose her in
      love with young Mr Chivery in the back-yard, or any such person. On the
      other hand, he reasoned with himself that she was just as good and just as
      true in love with him, as not in love with him; and that to make a kind of
      domesticated fairy of her, on the penalty of isolation at heart from the
      only people she knew, would be but a weakness of his own fancy, and not a
      kind one. Still, her youthful and ethereal appearance, her timid manner,
      the charm of her sensitive voice and eyes, the very many respects in which
      she had interested him out of her own individuality, and the strong
      difference between herself and those about her, were not in unison, and
      were determined not to be in unison, with this newly presented idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told the worthy Mrs Chivery, after turning these things over in his
      mind—he did that, indeed, while she was yet speaking—that he
      might be relied upon to do his utmost at all times to promote the
      happiness of Miss Dorrit, and to further the wishes of her heart if it
      were in his power to do so, and if he could discover what they were. At
      the same time he cautioned her against assumptions and appearances;
      enjoined strict silence and secrecy, lest Miss Dorrit should be made
      unhappy; and particularly advised her to endeavour to win her son’s
      confidence and so to make quite sure of the state of the case. Mrs Chivery
      considered the latter precaution superfluous, but said she would try. She
      shook her head as if she had not derived all the comfort she had fondly
      expected from this interview, but thanked him nevertheless for the trouble
      he had kindly taken. They then parted good friends, and Arthur walked
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in the street jostling the crowd in his mind, and the two crowds
      making a confusion, he avoided London Bridge, and turned off in the
      quieter direction of the Iron Bridge. He had scarcely set foot upon it,
      when he saw Little Dorrit walking on before him. It was a pleasant day,
      with a light breeze blowing, and she seemed to have that minute come there
      for air. He had left her in her father’s room within an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a timely chance, favourable to his wish of observing her face and
      manner when no one else was by. He quickened his pace; but before he
      reached her, she turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have I startled you?’ he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought I knew the step,’ she answered, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And did you know it, Little Dorrit? You could hardly have expected mine.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I did not expect any. But when I heard a step, I thought it—sounded
      like yours.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you going further?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, I am only walking here for a little change.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together, and she recovered her confiding manner with him, and
      looked up in his face as she said, after glancing around:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is so strange. Perhaps you can hardly understand it. I sometimes have
      a sensation as if it was almost unfeeling to walk here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Unfeeling?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To see the river, and so much sky, and so many objects, and such change
      and motion. Then to go back, you know, and find him in the same cramped
      place.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah yes! But going back, you must remember that you take with you the
      spirit and influence of such things to cheer him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do I? I hope I may! I am afraid you fancy too much, sir, and make me out
      too powerful. If you were in prison, could I bring such comfort to you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Little Dorrit, I am sure of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered from a tremor on her lip, and a passing shadow of great
      agitation on her face, that her mind was with her father. He remained
      silent for a few moments, that she might regain her composure. The Little
      Dorrit, trembling on his arm, was less in unison than ever with Mrs
      Chivery’s theory, and yet was not irreconcilable with a new fancy which
      sprung up within him, that there might be some one else in the hopeless—newer
      fancy still—in the hopeless unattainable distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned, and Clennam said, Here was Maggy coming! Little Dorrit looked
      up, surprised, and they confronted Maggy, who brought herself at sight of
      them to a dead stop. She had been trotting along, so preoccupied and busy
      that she had not recognised them until they turned upon her. She was now
      in a moment so conscience-stricken that her very basket partook of the
      change.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Maggy, you promised me to stop near father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So I would, Little Mother, only he wouldn’t let me. If he takes and sends
      me out I must go. If he takes and says, “Maggy, you hurry away and back
      with that letter, and you shall have a sixpence if the answer’s a good
      ‘un,” I must take it. Lor, Little Mother, what’s a poor thing of ten year
      old to do? And if Mr Tip—if he happens to be a coming in as I come
      out, and if he says “Where are you going, Maggy?” and if I says, “I’m a
      going So and So,” and if he says, “I’ll have a Try too,” and if he goes
      into the George and writes a letter and if he gives it me and says, “Take
      that one to the same place, and if the answer’s a good ‘un I’ll give you a
      shilling,” it ain’t my fault, mother!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur read, in Little Dorrit’s downcast eyes, to whom she foresaw that
      the letters were addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I’m a going So and So. There! That’s where I am a going to,’ said Maggy.
      ‘I’m a going So and So. It ain’t you, Little Mother, that’s got anything
      to do with it—it’s you, you know,’ said Maggy, addressing Arthur.
      ‘You’d better come, So and So, and let me take and give ‘em to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We will not be so particular as that, Maggy. Give them me here,’ said
      Clennam in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, then, come across the road,’ answered Maggy in a very loud whisper.
      ‘Little Mother wasn’t to know nothing of it, and she would never have
      known nothing of it if you had only gone So and So, instead of bothering
      and loitering about. It ain’t my fault. I must do what I am told. They
      ought to be ashamed of themselves for telling me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam crossed to the other side, and hurriedly opened the letters. That
      from the father mentioned that most unexpectedly finding himself in the
      novel position of having been disappointed of a remittance from the City
      on which he had confidently counted, he took up his pen, being restrained
      by the unhappy circumstance of his incarceration during three-and-twenty
      years (doubly underlined), from coming himself, as he would otherwise
      certainly have done—took up his pen to entreat Mr Clennam to advance
      him the sum of Three Pounds Ten Shillings upon his I.O.U., which he begged
      to enclose. That from the son set forth that Mr Clennam would, he knew, be
      gratified to hear that he had at length obtained permanent employment of a
      highly satisfactory nature, accompanied with every prospect of complete
      success in life; but that the temporary inability of his employer to pay
      him his arrears of salary to that date (in which condition said employer
      had appealed to that generous forbearance in which he trusted he should
      never be wanting towards a fellow-creature), combined with the fraudulent
      conduct of a false friend and the present high price of provisions, had
      reduced him to the verge of ruin, unless he could by a quarter before six
      that evening raise the sum of eight pounds. This sum, Mr Clennam would be
      happy to learn, he had, through the promptitude of several friends who had
      a lively confidence in his probity, already raised, with the exception of
      a trifling balance of one pound seventeen and fourpence; the loan of which
      balance, for the period of one month, would be fraught with the usual
      beneficent consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      These letters Clennam answered with the aid of his pencil and pocket-book,
      on the spot; sending the father what he asked for, and excusing himself
      from compliance with the demand of the son. He then commissioned Maggy to
      return with his replies, and gave her the shilling of which the failure of
      her supplemental enterprise would have disappointed her otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he rejoined Little Dorrit, and they had begun walking as before, she
      said all at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think I had better go. I had better go home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t be distressed,’ said Clennam, ‘I have answered the letters. They
      were nothing. You know what they were. They were nothing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I am afraid,’ she returned, ‘to leave him, I am afraid to leave any
      of them. When I am gone, they pervert—but they don’t mean it—even
      Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was a very innocent commission that she undertook, poor thing. And in
      keeping it secret from you, she supposed, no doubt, that she was only
      saving you uneasiness.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I hope so, I hope so. But I had better go home! It was but the other
      day that my sister told me I had become so used to the prison that I had
      its tone and character. It must be so. I am sure it must be when I see
      these things. My place is there. I am better there, it is unfeeling in me
      to be here, when I can do the least thing there. Good-bye. I had far
      better stay at home!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The agonised way in which she poured this out, as if it burst of itself
      from her suppressed heart, made it difficult for Clennam to keep the tears
      from his eyes as he saw and heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t call it home, my child!’ he entreated. ‘It is always painful to me
      to hear you call it home.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it is home! What else can I call home? Why should I ever forget it
      for a single moment?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You never do, dear Little Dorrit, in any good and true service.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope not, O I hope not! But it is better for me to stay there; much
      better, much more dutiful, much happier. Please don’t go with me, let me
      go by myself. Good-bye, God bless you. Thank you, thank you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that it was better to respect her entreaty, and did not move while
      her slight form went quickly away from him. When it had fluttered out of
      sight, he turned his face towards the water and stood thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have been distressed at any time by this discovery of the
      letters; but so much so, and in that unrestrainable way?
    </p>
    <p>
      No.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had seen her father begging with his threadbare disguise on, when
      she had entreated him not to give her father money, she had been
      distressed, but not like this. Something had made her keenly and
      additionally sensitive just now. Now, was there some one in the hopeless
      unattainable distance? Or had the suspicion been brought into his mind, by
      his own associations of the troubled river running beneath the bridge with
      the same river higher up, its changeless tune upon the prow of the
      ferry-boat, so many miles an hour the peaceful flowing of the stream, here
      the rushes, there the lilies, nothing uncertain or unquiet?
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of his poor child, Little Dorrit, for a long time there; he
      thought of her going home; he thought of her in the night; he thought of
      her when the day came round again. And the poor child Little Dorrit
      thought of him—too faithfully, ah, too faithfully!—in the
      shadow of the Marshalsea wall.

<p>Mr Meagles bestirred himself with such prompt activity in the matter of
      the negotiation with Daniel Doyce which Clennam had entrusted to him, that
      he soon brought it into business train, and called on Clennam at nine
      o’clock one morning to make his report.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Doyce is highly gratified by your good opinion,’ he opened the business
      by saying, ‘and desires nothing so much as that you should examine the
      affairs of the Works for yourself, and entirely understand them. He has
      handed me the keys of all his books and papers—here they are
      jingling in this pocket—and the only charge he has given me is “Let
      Mr Clennam have the means of putting himself on a perfect equality with me
      as to knowing whatever I know. If it should come to nothing after all, he
      will respect my confidence. Unless I was sure of that to begin with, I
      should have nothing to do with him.” And there, you see,’ said Mr Meagles,
      ‘you have Daniel Doyce all over.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A very honourable character.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, yes, to be sure. Not a doubt of it. Odd, but very honourable. Very
      odd though. Now, would you believe, Clennam,’ said Mr Meagles, with a
      hearty enjoyment of his friend’s eccentricity, ‘that I had a whole morning
      in What’s-his-name Yard—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bleeding Heart?’

    <p>
      ‘A whole morning in Bleeding Heart Yard, before I could induce him to
      pursue the subject at all?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How was that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How was that, my friend? I no sooner mentioned your name in connection
      with it than he declared off.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Declared off on my account?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I no sooner mentioned your name, Clennam, than he said, “That will never
      do!” What did he mean by that? I asked him. No matter, Meagles; that would
      never do. Why would it never do? You’ll hardly believe it, Clennam,’ said
      Mr Meagles, laughing within himself, ‘but it came out that it would never
      do, because you and he, walking down to Twickenham together, had glided
      into a friendly conversation in the course of which he had referred to his
      intention of taking a partner, supposing at the time that you were as
      firmly and finally settled as St Paul’s Cathedral. “Whereas,” says he, “Mr
      Clennam might now believe, if I entertained his proposition, that I had a
      sinister and designing motive in what was open free speech. Which I can’t
      bear,” says he, “which I really am too proud to bear.”’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I should as soon suspect—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course you would,’ interrupted Mr Meagles, ‘and so I told him. But it
      took a morning to scale that wall; and I doubt if any other man than
      myself (he likes me of old) could have got his leg over it. Well, Clennam.
      This business-like obstacle surmounted, he then stipulated that before
      resuming with you I should look over the books and form my own opinion. I
      looked over the books, and formed my own opinion. “Is it, on the whole,
      for, or against?” says he. “For,” says I. “Then,” says he, “you may now,
      my good friend, give Mr Clennam the means of forming his opinion. To
      enable him to do which, without bias and with perfect freedom, I shall go
      out of town for a week.” And he’s gone,’ said Mr Meagles; ‘that’s the rich
      conclusion of the thing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Leaving me,’ said Clennam, ‘with a high sense, I must say, of his candour
      and his—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oddity,’ Mr Meagles struck in. ‘I should think so!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not exactly the word on Clennam’s lips, but he forbore to interrupt
      his good-humoured friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And now,’ added Mr Meagles, ‘you can begin to look into matters as soon
      as you think proper. I have undertaken to explain where you may want
      explanation, but to be strictly impartial, and to do nothing more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They began their perquisitions in Bleeding Heart Yard that same forenoon.
      Little peculiarities were easily to be detected by experienced eyes in Mr
      Doyce’s way of managing his affairs, but they almost always involved some
      ingenious simplification of a difficulty, and some plain road to the
      desired end. That his papers were in arrear, and that he stood in need of
      assistance to develop the capacity of his business, was clear enough; but
      all the results of his undertakings during many years were distinctly set
      forth, and were ascertainable with ease. Nothing had been done for the
      purposes of the pending investigation; everything was in its genuine
      working dress, and in a certain honest rugged order. The calculations and
      entries, in his own hand, of which there were many, were bluntly written,
      and with no very neat precision; but were always plain and directed
      straight to the purpose. It occurred to Arthur that a far more elaborate
      and taking show of business—such as the records of the
      Circumlocution Office made perhaps—might be far less serviceable, as
      being meant to be far less intelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four days of steady application tendered him master of all the
      facts it was essential to become acquainted with. Mr Meagles was at hand
      the whole time, always ready to illuminate any dim place with the bright
      little safety-lamp belonging to the scales and scoop. Between them they
      agreed upon the sum it would be fair to offer for the purchase of a
      half-share in the business, and then Mr Meagles unsealed a paper in which
      Daniel Doyce had noted the amount at which he valued it; which was even
      something less. Thus, when Daniel came back, he found the affair as good
      as concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I may now avow, Mr Clennam,’ said he, with a cordial shake of the
      hand, ‘that if I had looked high and low for a partner, I believe I could
      not have found one more to my mind.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say the same,’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And I say of both of you,’ added Mr Meagles, ‘that you are well matched.
      You keep him in check, Clennam, with your common sense, and you stick to
      the Works, Dan, with your—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Uncommon sense?’ suggested Daniel, with his quiet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You may call it so, if you like—and each of you will be a right
      hand to the other. Here’s my own right hand upon it, as a practical man,
      to both of you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The purchase was completed within a month. It left Arthur in possession of
      private personal means not exceeding a few hundred pounds; but it opened
      to him an active and promising career. The three friends dined together on
      the auspicious occasion; the factory and the factory wives and children
      made holiday and dined too; even Bleeding Heart Yard dined and was full of
      meat. Two months had barely gone by in all, when Bleeding Heart Yard had
      become so familiar with short-commons again, that the treat was forgotten
      there; when nothing seemed new in the partnership but the paint of the
      inscription on the door-posts, DOYCE AND CLENNAM; when it appeared even to
      Clennam himself, that he had had the affairs of the firm in his mind for
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little counting-house reserved for his own occupation, was a room of
      wood and glass at the end of a long low workshop, filled with benches, and
      vices, and tools, and straps, and wheels; which, when they were in gear
      with the steam-engine, went tearing round as though they had a suicidal
      mission to grind the business to dust and tear the factory to pieces. A
      communication of great trap-doors in the floor and roof with the workshop
      above and the workshop below, made a shaft of light in this perspective,
      which brought to Clennam’s mind the child’s old picture-book, where
      similar rays were the witnesses of Abel’s murder. The noises were
      sufficiently removed and shut out from the counting-house to blend into a
      busy hum, interspersed with periodical clinks and thumps. The patient
      figures at work were swarthy with the filings of iron and steel that
      danced on every bench and bubbled up through every chink in the planking.
      The workshop was arrived at by a step-ladder from the outer yard below,
      where it served as a shelter for the large grindstone where tools were
      sharpened. The whole had at once a fanciful and practical air in Clennam’s
      eyes, which was a welcome change; and, as often as he raised them from his
      first work of getting the array of business documents into perfect order,
      he glanced at these things with a feeling of pleasure in his pursuit that
      was new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising his eyes thus one day, he was surprised to see a bonnet labouring
      up the step-ladder. The unusual apparition was followed by another bonnet.
      He then perceived that the first bonnet was on the head of Mr F.‘s Aunt,
      and that the second bonnet was on the head of Flora, who seemed to have
      propelled her legacy up the steep ascent with considerable difficulty.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Though not altogether enraptured at the sight of these visitors, Clennam
      lost no time in opening the counting-house door, and extricating them from
      the workshop; a rescue which was rendered the more necessary by Mr F.‘s
      Aunt already stumbling over some impediment, and menacing steam power as
      an Institution with a stony reticule she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good gracious, Arthur,—I should say Mr Clennam, far more proper—the
      climb we have had to get up here and how ever to get down again without a
      fire-escape and Mr F.‘s Aunt slipping through the steps and bruised all
      over and you in the machinery and foundry way too only think, and never
      told us!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, Flora, out of breath. Meanwhile, Mr F.‘s Aunt rubbed her esteemed
      insteps with her umbrella, and vindictively glared.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Most unkind never to have come back to see us since that day, though
      naturally it was not to be expected that there should be any attraction at
      <i>our</i> house and you were much more pleasantly engaged, that’s pretty
      certain, and is she fair or dark blue eyes or black I wonder, not that I
      expect that she should be anything but a perfect contrast to me in all
      particulars for I am a disappointment as I very well know and you are
      quite right to be devoted no doubt though what I am saying Arthur never
      mind I hardly know myself Good gracious!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time he had placed chairs for them in the counting-house. As Flora
      dropped into hers, she bestowed the old look upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And to think of Doyce and Clennam, and who Doyce can be,’ said Flora;
      ‘delightful man no doubt and married perhaps or perhaps a daughter, now
      has he really? then one understands the partnership and sees it all, don’t
      tell me anything about it for I know I have no claim to ask the question
      the golden chain that once was forged being snapped and very proper.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora put her hand tenderly on his, and gave him another of the youthful
      glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear Arthur—force of habit, Mr Clennam every way more delicate and
      adapted to existing circumstances—I must beg to be excused for
      taking the liberty of this intrusion but I thought I might so far presume
      upon old times for ever faded never more to bloom as to call with Mr F.‘s
      Aunt to congratulate and offer best wishes, A great deal superior to China
      not to be denied and much nearer though higher up!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am very happy to see you,’ said Clennam, ‘and I thank you, Flora, very
      much for your kind remembrance.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘More than I can say myself at any rate,’ returned Flora, ‘for I might
      have been dead and buried twenty distinct times over and no doubt whatever
      should have been before you had genuinely remembered Me or anything like
      it in spite of which one last remark I wish to make, one last explanation
      I wish to offer—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Mrs Finching,’ Arthur remonstrated in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh not that disagreeable name, say Flora!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flora, is it worth troubling yourself afresh to enter into explanations?
      I assure you none are needed. I am satisfied—I am perfectly
      satisfied.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A diversion was occasioned here, by Mr F.‘s Aunt making the following
      inexorable and awful statement:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There’s mile-stones on the Dover road!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With such mortal hostility towards the human race did she discharge this
      missile, that Clennam was quite at a loss how to defend himself; the
      rather as he had been already perplexed in his mind by the honour of a
      visit from this venerable lady, when it was plain she held him in the
      utmost abhorrence. He could not but look at her with disconcertment, as
      she sat breathing bitterness and scorn, and staring leagues away. Flora,
      however, received the remark as if it had been of a most apposite and
      agreeable nature; approvingly observing aloud that Mr F.‘s Aunt had a
      great deal of spirit. Stimulated either by this compliment, or by her
      burning indignation, that illustrious woman then added, ‘Let him meet it
      if he can!’ And, with a rigid movement of her stony reticule (an appendage
      of great size and of a fossil appearance), indicated that Clennam was the
      unfortunate person at whom the challenge was hurled.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘One last remark,’ resumed Flora, ‘I was going to say I wish to make one
      last explanation I wish to offer, Mr F.‘s Aunt and myself would not have
      intruded on business hours Mr F. having been in business and though the
      wine trade still business is equally business call it what you will and
      business habits are just the same as witness Mr F. himself who had his
      slippers always on the mat at ten minutes before six in the afternoon and
      his boots inside the fender at ten minutes before eight in the morning to
      the moment in all weathers light or dark—would not therefore have
      intruded without a motive which being kindly meant it may be hoped will be
      kindly taken Arthur, Mr Clennam far more proper, even Doyce and Clennam
      probably more business-like.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray say nothing in the way of apology,’ Arthur entreated. ‘You are
      always welcome.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very polite of you to say so Arthur—cannot remember Mr Clennam
      until the word is out, such is the habit of times for ever fled, and so
      true it is that oft in the stilly night ere slumber’s chain has bound
      people, fond memory brings the light of other days around people—very
      polite but more polite than true I am afraid, for to go into the machinery
      business without so much as sending a line or a card to papa—I don’t
      say me though there was a time but that is past and stern reality has now
      my gracious never mind—does not look like it you must confess.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Flora’s commas seemed to have fled on this occasion; she was so much
      more disjointed and voluble than in the preceding interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Though indeed,’ she hurried on, ‘nothing else is to be expected and why
      should it be expected and if it’s not to be expected why should it be, and
      I am far from blaming you or any one, When your mama and my papa worried
      us to death and severed the golden bowl—I mean bond but I dare say
      you know what I mean and if you don’t you don’t lose much and care just as
      little I will venture to add—when they severed the golden bond that
      bound us and threw us into fits of crying on the sofa nearly choked at
      least myself everything was changed and in giving my hand to Mr F. I know
      I did so with my eyes open but he was so very unsettled and in such low
      spirits that he had distractedly alluded to the river if not oil of
      something from the chemist’s and I did it for the best.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My good Flora, we settled that before. It was all quite right.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s perfectly clear you think so,’ returned Flora, ‘for you take it very
      coolly, if I hadn’t known it to be China I should have guessed myself the
      Polar regions, dear Mr Clennam you are right however and I cannot blame
      you but as to Doyce and Clennam papa’s property being about here we heard
      it from Pancks and but for him we never should have heard one word about
      it I am satisfied.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no, don’t say that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What nonsense not to say it Arthur—Doyce and Clennam—easier
      and less trying to me than Mr Clennam—when I know it and you know it
      too and can’t deny it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I do deny it, Flora. I should soon have made you a friendly visit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah!’ said Flora, tossing her head. ‘I dare say!’ and she gave him another
      of the old looks. ‘However when Pancks told us I made up my mind that Mr
      F.‘s Aunt and I would come and call because when papa—which was
      before that—happened to mention her name to me and to say that you
      were interested in her I said at the moment Good gracious why not have her
      here then when there’s anything to do instead of putting it out.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When you say Her,’ observed Clennam, by this time pretty well bewildered,
      ‘do you mean Mr F.‘s—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My goodness, Arthur—Doyce and Clennam really easier to me with old
      remembrances—who ever heard of Mr F.‘s Aunt doing needlework and
      going out by the day?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Going out by the day! Do you speak of Little Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why yes of course,’ returned Flora; ‘and of all the strangest names I
      ever heard the strangest, like a place down in the country with a
      turnpike, or a favourite pony or a puppy or a bird or something from a
      seed-shop to be put in a garden or a flower-pot and come up speckled.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then, Flora,’ said Arthur, with a sudden interest in the conversation,
      ‘Mr Casby was so kind as to mention Little Dorrit to you, was he? What did
      he say?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh you know what papa is,’ rejoined Flora, ‘and how aggravatingly he sits
      looking beautiful and turning his thumbs over and over one another till he
      makes one giddy if one keeps one’s eyes upon him, he said when we were
      talking of you—I don’t know who began the subject Arthur (Doyce and
      Clennam) but I am sure it wasn’t me, at least I hope not but you really
      must excuse my confessing more on that point.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly,’ said Arthur. ‘By all means.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are very ready,’ pouted Flora, coming to a sudden stop in a
      captivating bashfulness, ‘that I must admit, Papa said you had spoken of
      her in an earnest way and I said what I have told you and that’s all.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s all?’ said Arthur, a little disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Except that when Pancks told us of your having embarked in this business
      and with difficulty persuaded us that it was really you I said to Mr F.‘s
      Aunt then we would come and ask you if it would be agreeable to all
      parties that she should be engaged at our house when required for I know
      she often goes to your mama’s and I know that your mama has a very touchy
      temper Arthur—Doyce and Clennam—or I never might have married
      Mr F. and might have been at this hour but I am running into nonsense.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was very kind of you, Flora, to think of this.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Flora rejoined with a plain sincerity which became her better than
      her youngest glances, that she was glad he thought so. She said it with so
      much heart that Clennam would have given a great deal to buy his old
      character of her on the spot, and throw it and the mermaid away for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think, Flora,’ he said, ‘that the employment you can give Little
      Dorrit, and the kindness you can show her—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes and I will,’ said Flora, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sure of it—will be a great assistance and support to her. I do
      not feel that I have the right to tell you what I know of her, for I
      acquired the knowledge confidentially, and under circumstances that bind
      me to silence. But I have an interest in the little creature, and a
      respect for her that I cannot express to you. Her life has been one of
      such trial and devotion, and such quiet goodness, as you can scarcely
      imagine. I can hardly think of her, far less speak of her, without feeling
      moved. Let that feeling represent what I could tell you, and commit her to
      your friendliness with my thanks.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more he put out his hand frankly to poor Flora; once more poor Flora
      couldn’t accept it frankly, found it worth nothing openly, must make the
      old intrigue and mystery of it. As much to her own enjoyment as to his
      dismay, she covered it with a corner of her shawl as she took it. Then,
      looking towards the glass front of the counting-house, and seeing two
      figures approaching, she cried with infinite relish, ‘Papa! Hush, Arthur,
      for Mercy’s sake!’ and tottered back to her chair with an amazing
      imitation of being in danger of swooning, in the dread surprise and
      maidenly flutter of her spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patriarch, meanwhile, came inanely beaming towards the counting-house
      in the wake of Pancks. Pancks opened the door for him, towed him in, and
      retired to his own moorings in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I heard from Flora,’ said the Patriarch with his benevolent smile, ‘that
      she was coming to call, coming to call. And being out, I thought I’d come
      also, thought I’d come also.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The benign wisdom he infused into this declaration (not of itself
      profound), by means of his blue eyes, his shining head, and his long white
      hair, was most impressive. It seemed worth putting down among the noblest
      sentiments enunciated by the best of men. Also, when he said to Clennam,
      seating himself in the proffered chair, ‘And you are in a new business, Mr
      Clennam? I wish you well, sir, I wish you well!’ he seemed to have done
      benevolent wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Finching has been telling me, sir,’ said Arthur, after making his
      acknowledgments; the relict of the late Mr F. meanwhile protesting, with a
      gesture, against his use of that respectable name; ‘that she hopes
      occasionally to employ the young needlewoman you recommended to my mother.
      For which I have been thanking her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Patriarch turning his head in a lumbering way towards Pancks, that
      assistant put up the note-book in which he had been absorbed, and took him
      in tow.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You didn’t recommend her, you know,’ said Pancks; ‘how could you? You
      knew nothing about her, you didn’t. The name was mentioned to you, and you
      passed it on. That’s what <i>you</i> did.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ said Clennam. ‘As she justifies any recommendation, it is much the
      same thing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are glad she turns out well,’ said Pancks, ‘but it wouldn’t have been
      your fault if she had turned out ill. The credit’s not yours as it is, and
      the blame wouldn’t have been yours as it might have been. You gave no
      guarantee. You knew nothing about her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are not acquainted, then,’ said Arthur, hazarding a random question,
      ‘with any of her family?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Acquainted with any of her family?’ returned Pancks. ‘How should you be
      acquainted with any of her family? You never heard of ‘em. You can’t be
      acquainted with people you never heard of, can you? You should think not!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the Patriarch sat serenely smiling; nodding or shaking his
      head benevolently, as the case required.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to being a reference,’ said Pancks, ‘you know, in a general way, what
      being a reference means. It’s all your eye, that is! Look at your tenants
      down the Yard here. They’d all be references for one another, if you’d let
      ‘em. What would be the good of letting ‘em? It’s no satisfaction to be
      done by two men instead of one. One’s enough. A person who can’t pay, gets
      another person who can’t pay, to guarantee that he can pay. Like a person
      with two wooden legs getting another person with two wooden legs, to
      guarantee that he has got two natural legs. It don’t make either of them
      able to do a walking match. And four wooden legs are more troublesome to
      you than two, when you don’t want any.’ Mr Pancks concluded by blowing off
      that steam of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary silence that ensued was broken by Mr F.‘s Aunt, who had been
      sitting upright in a cataleptic state since her last public remark. She
      now underwent a violent twitch, calculated to produce a startling effect
      on the nerves of the uninitiated, and with the deadliest animosity
      observed:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You can’t make a head and brains out of a brass knob with nothing in it.
      You couldn’t do it when your Uncle George was living; much less when he’s
      dead.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks was not slow to reply, with his usual calmness, ‘Indeed, ma’am!
      Bless my soul! I’m surprised to hear it.’ Despite his presence of mind,
      however, the speech of Mr F.‘s Aunt produced a depressing effect on the
      little assembly; firstly, because it was impossible to disguise that
      Clennam’s unoffending head was the particular temple of reason
      depreciated; and secondly, because nobody ever knew on these occasions
      whose Uncle George was referred to, or what spectral presence might be
      invoked under that appellation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Flora said, though still not without a certain boastfulness and
      triumph in her legacy, that Mr F.‘s Aunt was ‘very lively to-day, and she
      thought they had better go.’ But Mr F.‘s Aunt proved so lively as to take
      the suggestion in unexpected dudgeon and declare that she would not go;
      adding, with several injurious expressions, that if ‘He’—too
      evidently meaning Clennam—wanted to get rid of her, ‘let him chuck
      her out of winder;’ and urgently expressing her desire to see ‘Him’ 
      perform that ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dilemma, Mr Pancks, whose resources appeared equal to any
      emergency in the Patriarchal waters, slipped on his hat, slipped out at
      the counting-house door, and slipped in again a moment afterwards with an
      artificial freshness upon him, as if he had been in the country for some
      weeks. ‘Why, bless my heart, ma’am!’ said Mr Pancks, rubbing up his hair
      in great astonishment, ‘is that you? How do you <i>do</i>, ma’am? You are
      looking charming to-day! I am delighted to see you. Favour me with your
      arm, ma’am; we’ll have a little walk together, you and me, if you’ll
      honour me with your company.’ And so escorted Mr F.‘s Aunt down the
      private staircase of the counting-house with great gallantry and success.
      The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself,
      and blandly followed: leaving his daughter, as she followed in her turn,
      to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper (which she very much
      enjoyed), that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs; and further
      to hint mysteriously that the late Mr F. was at the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone again, Clennam became a prey to his old doubts in reference to his
      mother and Little Dorrit, and revolved the old thoughts and suspicions.
      They were all in his mind, blending themselves with the duties he was
      mechanically discharging, when a shadow on his papers caused him to look
      up for the cause. The cause was Mr Pancks. With his hat thrown back upon
      his ears as if his wiry prongs of hair had darted up like springs and cast
      it off, with his jet-black beads of eyes inquisitively sharp, with the
      fingers of his right hand in his mouth that he might bite the nails, and
      with the fingers of his left hand in reserve in his pocket for another
      course, Mr Pancks cast his shadow through the glass upon the books and
      papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks asked, with a little inquiring twist of his head, if he might
      come in again? Clennam replied with a nod of his head in the affirmative.
      Mr Pancks worked his way in, came alongside the desk, made himself fast by
      leaning his arms upon it, and started conversation with a puff and a
      snort.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr F.‘s Aunt is appeased, I hope?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All right, sir,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am so unfortunate as to have awakened a strong animosity in the breast
      of that lady,’ said Clennam. ‘Do you know why?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does <i>she</i> know why?’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I suppose not.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>I</i> suppose not,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took out his note-book, opened it, shut it, dropped it into his hat,
      which was beside him on the desk, and looked in at it as it lay at the
      bottom of the hat: all with a great appearance of consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam,’ he then began, ‘I am in want of information, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Connected with this firm?’ asked Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘With what then, Mr Pancks? That is to say, assuming that you want it of
      me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, sir; yes, I want it of you,’ said Pancks, ‘if I can persuade you to
      furnish it. A, B, C, D. DA, DE, DI, DO. Dictionary order. Dorrit. That’s
      the name, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks blew off his peculiar noise again, and fell to at his right-hand
      nails. Arthur looked searchingly at him; he returned the look.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t understand you, Mr Pancks.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s the name that I want to know about.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what do you want to know?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Whatever you can and will tell me.’ This comprehensive summary of his
      desires was not discharged without some heavy labouring on the part of Mr
      Pancks’s machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is a singular visit, Mr Pancks. It strikes me as rather
      extraordinary that you should come, with such an object, to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It may be all extraordinary together,’ returned Pancks. ‘It may be out of
      the ordinary course, and yet be business. In short, it is business. I am a
      man of business. What business have I in this present world, except to
      stick to business? No business.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With his former doubt whether this dry hard personage were quite in
      earnest, Clennam again turned his eyes attentively upon his face. It was
      as scrubby and dingy as ever, and as eager and quick as ever, and he could
      see nothing lurking in it that was at all expressive of a latent mockery
      that had seemed to strike upon his ear in the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now,’ said Pancks, ‘to put this business on its own footing, it’s not my
      proprietor’s.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do you refer to Mr Casby as your proprietor?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pancks nodded. ‘My proprietor. Put a case. Say, at my proprietor’s I hear
      name—name of young person Mr Clennam wants to serve. Say, name first
      mentioned to my proprietor by Plornish in the Yard. Say, I go to Plornish.
      Say, I ask Plornish as a matter of business for information. Say,
      Plornish, though six weeks in arrear to my proprietor, declines. Say, Mrs
      Plornish declines. Say, both refer to Mr Clennam. Put the case.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, sir,’ returned Pancks, ‘say, I come to him. Say, here I am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those prongs of hair sticking up all over his head, and his breath
      coming and going very hard and short, the busy Pancks fell back a step (in
      Tug metaphor, took half a turn astern) as if to show his dingy hull
      complete, then forged a-head again, and directed his quick glance by turns
      into his hat where his note-book was, and into Clennam’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Pancks, not to trespass on your grounds of mystery, I will be as plain
      with you as I can. Let me ask two questions. First—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All right!’ said Pancks, holding up his dirty forefinger with his broken
      nail. ‘I see! “What’s your motive?”’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Exactly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Motive,’ said Pancks, ‘good. Nothing to do with my proprietor; not
      stateable at present, ridiculous to state at present; but good. Desiring
      to serve young person, name of Dorrit,’ said Pancks, with his forefinger
      still up as a caution. ‘Better admit motive to be good.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Secondly, and lastly, what do you want to know?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks fished up his note-book before the question was put, and
      buttoning it with care in an inner breast-pocket, and looking straight at
      Clennam all the time, replied with a pause and a puff, ‘I want
      supplementary information of any sort.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam could not withhold a smile, as the panting little steam-tug, so
      useful to that unwieldy ship, the Casby, waited on and watched him as if
      it were seeking an opportunity of running in and rifling him of all he
      wanted before he could resist its manoeuvres; though there was that in Mr
      Pancks’s eagerness, too, which awakened many wondering speculations in his
      mind. After a little consideration, he resolved to supply Mr Pancks with
      such leading information as it was in his power to impart him; well
      knowing that Mr Pancks, if he failed in his present research, was pretty
      sure to find other means of getting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, therefore, first requesting Mr Pancks to remember his voluntary
      declaration that his proprietor had no part in the disclosure, and that
      his own intentions were good (two declarations which that coaly little
      gentleman with the greatest ardour repeated), openly told him that as to
      the Dorrit lineage or former place of habitation, he had no information to
      communicate, and that his knowledge of the family did not extend beyond
      the fact that it appeared to be now reduced to five members; namely, to
      two brothers, of whom one was single, and one a widower with three
      children. The ages of the whole family he made known to Mr Pancks, as
      nearly as he could guess at them; and finally he described to him the
      position of the Father of the Marshalsea, and the course of time and
      events through which he had become invested with that character. To all
      this, Mr Pancks, snorting and blowing in a more and more portentous manner
      as he became more interested, listened with great attention; appearing to
      derive the most agreeable sensations from the painfullest parts of the
      narrative, and particularly to be quite charmed by the account of William
      Dorrit’s long imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In conclusion, Mr Pancks,’ said Arthur, ‘I have but to say this. I have
      reasons beyond a personal regard for speaking as little as I can of the
      Dorrit family, particularly at my mother’s house’ (Mr Pancks nodded), ‘and
      for knowing as much as I can. So devoted a man of business as you are—eh?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mr Pancks had suddenly made that blowing effort with unusual force.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s nothing,’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So devoted a man of business as yourself has a perfect understanding of a
      fair bargain. I wish to make a fair bargain with you, that you shall
      enlighten me concerning the Dorrit family when you have it in your power,
      as I have enlightened you. It may not give you a very flattering idea of
      my business habits, that I failed to make my terms beforehand,’ continued
      Clennam; ‘but I prefer to make them a point of honour. I have seen so much
      business done on sharp principles that, to tell you the truth, Mr Pancks,
      I am tired of them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks laughed. ‘It’s a bargain, sir,’ said he. ‘You shall find me
      stick to it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, he stood a little while looking at Clennam, and biting his ten
      nails all round; evidently while he fixed in his mind what he had been
      told, and went over it carefully, before the means of supplying a gap in
      his memory should be no longer at hand. ‘It’s all right,’ he said at last,
      ‘and now I’ll wish you good day, as it’s collecting day in the Yard.
      By-the-bye, though. A lame foreigner with a stick.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ay, ay. You do take a reference sometimes, I see?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When he can pay, sir,’ replied Pancks. ‘Take all you can get, and keep
      back all you can’t be forced to give up. That’s business. The lame
      foreigner with the stick wants a top room down the Yard. Is he good for
      it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am,’ said Clennam, ‘and I will answer for him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s enough. What I must have of Bleeding Heart Yard,’ said Pancks,
      making a note of the case in his book, ‘is my bond. I want my bond, you
      see. Pay up, or produce your property! That’s the watchword down the Yard.
      The lame foreigner with the stick represented that you sent him; but he
      could represent (as far as that goes) that the Great Mogul sent him. He
      has been in the hospital, I believe?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. Through having met with an accident. He is only just now
      discharged.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s pauperising a man, sir, I have been shown, to let him into a
      hospital?’ said Pancks. And again blew off that remarkable sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have been shown so too,’ said Clennam, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks, being by that time quite ready for a start, got under steam in
      a moment, and, without any other signal or ceremony, was snorting down the
      step-ladder and working into Bleeding Heart Yard, before he seemed to be
      well out of the counting-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the remainder of the day, Bleeding Heart Yard was in
      consternation, as the grim Pancks cruised in it; haranguing the
      inhabitants on their backslidings in respect of payment, demanding his
      bond, breathing notices to quit and executions, running down defaulters,
      sending a swell of terror on before him, and leaving it in his wake. Knots
      of people, impelled by a fatal attraction, lurked outside any house in
      which he was known to be, listening for fragments of his discourses to the
      inmates; and, when he was rumoured to be coming down the stairs, often
      could not disperse so quickly but that he would be prematurely in among
      them, demanding their own arrears, and rooting them to the spot.
      Throughout the remainder of the day, Mr Pancks’s What were they up to? and
      What did they mean by it? sounded all over the Yard. Mr Pancks wouldn’t
      hear of excuses, wouldn’t hear of complaints, wouldn’t hear of repairs,
      wouldn’t hear of anything but unconditional money down. Perspiring and
      puffing and darting about in eccentric directions, and becoming hotter and
      dingier every moment, he lashed the tide of the yard into a most agitated
      and turbid state. It had not settled down into calm water again full two
      hours after he had been seen fuming away on the horizon at the top of the
      steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several small assemblages of the Bleeding Hearts at the popular
      points of meeting in the Yard that night, among whom it was universally
      agreed that Mr Pancks was a hard man to have to do with; and that it was
      much to be regretted, so it was, that a gentleman like Mr Casby should put
      his rents in his hands, and never know him in his true light. For (said
      the Bleeding Hearts), if a gentleman with that head of hair and them eyes
      took his rents into his own hands, ma’am, there would be none of this
      worriting and wearing, and things would be very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      At which identical evening hour and minute, the Patriarch—who had
      floated serenely through the Yard in the forenoon before the harrying
      began, with the express design of getting up this trustfulness in his
      shining bumps and silken locks—at which identical hour and minute,
      that first-rate humbug of a thousand guns was heavily floundering in the
      little Dock of his exhausted Tug at home, and was saying, as he turned his
      thumbs:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A very bad day’s work, Pancks, very bad day’s work. It seems to me, sir,
      and I must insist on making this observation forcibly in justice to
      myself, that you ought to have got much more money, much more money.’

	</hgroup>
<p>Little Dorrit received a call that same evening from Mr Plornish, who,
      having intimated that he wished to speak to her privately, in a series of
      coughs so very noticeable as to favour the idea that her father, as
      regarded her seamstress occupation, was an illustration of the axiom that
      there are no such stone-blind men as those who will not see, obtained an
      audience with her on the common staircase outside the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There’s been a lady at our place to-day, Miss Dorrit,’ Plornish growled,
      ‘and another one along with her as is a old wixen if ever I met with such.
      The way she snapped a person’s head off, dear me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mild Plornish was at first quite unable to get his mind away from Mr
      F.‘s Aunt. ‘For,’ said he, to excuse himself, ‘she is, I do assure you,
      the winegariest party.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, by a great effort, he detached himself from the subject
      sufficiently to observe:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But she’s neither here nor there just at present. The other lady, she’s
      Mr Casby’s daughter; and if Mr Casby an’t well off, none better, it an’t
      through any fault of Pancks. For, as to Pancks, he does, he really does,
      he does indeed!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Plornish, after his usual manner, was a little obscure, but
      conscientiously emphatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what she come to our place for,’ he pursued, ‘was to leave word that
      if Miss Dorrit would step up to that card—which it’s Mr Casby’s
      house that is, and Pancks he has a office at the back, where he really
      does, beyond belief—she would be glad for to engage her. She was a
      old and a dear friend, she said particular, of Mr Clennam, and hoped for
      to prove herself a useful friend to <i>his</i> friend. Them was her words.
      Wishing to know whether Miss Dorrit could come to-morrow morning, I said I
      would see you, Miss, and inquire, and look round there to-night, to say
      yes, or, if you was engaged to-morrow, when?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can go to-morrow, thank you,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘This is very kind of
      you, but you are always kind.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Plornish, with a modest disavowal of his merits, opened the room door
      for her readmission, and followed her in with such an exceedingly bald
      pretence of not having been out at all, that her father might have
      observed it without being very suspicious. In his affable unconsciousness,
      however, he took no heed. Plornish, after a little conversation, in which
      he blended his former duty as a Collegian with his present privilege as a
      humble outside friend, qualified again by his low estate as a plasterer,
      took his leave; making the tour of the prison before he left, and looking
      on at a game of skittles with the mixed feelings of an old inhabitant who
      had his private reasons for believing that it might be his destiny to come
      back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the morning, Little Dorrit, leaving Maggy in high domestic trust,
      set off for the Patriarchal tent. She went by the Iron Bridge, though it
      cost her a penny, and walked more slowly in that part of her journey than
      in any other. At five minutes before eight her hand was on the Patriarchal
      knocker, which was quite as high as she could reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave Mrs Finching’s card to the young woman who opened the door, and
      the young woman told her that ‘Miss Flora’—Flora having, on her
      return to the parental roof, reinvested herself with the title under which
      she had lived there—was not yet out of her bedroom, but she was to
      please to walk up into Miss Flora’s sitting-room. She walked up into Miss
      Flora’s sitting-room, as in duty bound, and there found a breakfast-table
      comfortably laid for two, with a supplementary tray upon it laid for one.
      The young woman, disappearing for a few moments, returned to say that she
      was to please to take a chair by the fire, and to take off her bonnet and
      make herself at home. But Little Dorrit, being bashful, and not used to
      make herself at home on such occasions, felt at a loss how to do it; so
      she was still sitting near the door with her bonnet on, when Flora came in
      in a hurry half an hour afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora was so sorry to have kept her waiting, and good gracious why did she
      sit out there in the cold when she had expected to find her by the fire
      reading the paper, and hadn’t that heedless girl given her the message
      then, and had she really been in her bonnet all this time, and pray for
      goodness sake let Flora take it off! Flora taking it off in the
      best-natured manner in the world, was so struck with the face disclosed,
      that she said, ‘Why, what a good little thing you are, my dear!’ and
      pressed her face between her hands like the gentlest of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the word and the action of a moment. Little Dorrit had hardly time
      to think how kind it was, when Flora dashed at the breakfast-table full of
      business, and plunged over head and ears into loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really so sorry that I should happen to be late on this morning of all
      mornings because my intention and my wish was to be ready to meet you when
      you came in and to say that any one that interested Arthur Clennam half so
      much must interest me and that I gave you the heartiest welcome and was so
      glad, instead of which they never called me and there I still am snoring I
      dare say if the truth was known and if you don’t like either cold fowl or
      hot boiled ham which many people don’t I dare say besides Jews and theirs
      are scruples of conscience which we must all respect though I must say I
      wish they had them equally strong when they sell us false articles for
      real that certainly ain’t worth the money I shall be quite vexed,’ said
      Flora.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit thanked her, and said, shyly, bread-and-butter and tea was
      all she usually—
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh nonsense my dear child I can never hear of that,’ said Flora, turning
      on the urn in the most reckless manner, and making herself wink by
      splashing hot water into her eyes as she bent down to look into the
      teapot. ‘You are coming here on the footing of a friend and companion you
      know if you will let me take that liberty and I should be ashamed of
      myself indeed if you could come here upon any other, besides which Arthur
      Clennam spoke in such terms—you are tired my dear.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You turn so pale you have walked too far before breakfast and I dare say
      live a great way off and ought to have had a ride,’ said Flora, ‘dear dear
      is there anything that would do you good?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed I am quite well, ma’am. I thank you again and again, but I am
      quite well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then take your tea at once I beg,’ said Flora, ‘and this wing of fowl and
      bit of ham, don’t mind me or wait for me, because I always carry in this
      tray myself to Mr F.‘s Aunt who breakfasts in bed and a charming old lady
      too and very clever, Portrait of Mr F. behind the door and very like
      though too much forehead and as to a pillar with a marble pavement and
      balustrades and a mountain, I never saw him near it nor not likely in the
      wine trade, excellent man but not at all in that way.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait, very imperfectly following the
      references to that work of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr F. was so devoted to me that he never could bear me out of his sight,’ 
      said Flora, ‘though of course I am unable to say how long that might have
      lasted if he hadn’t been cut short while I was a new broom, worthy man but
      not poetical manly prose but not romance.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit glanced at the portrait again. The artist had given it a
      head that would have been, in an intellectual point of view, top-heavy for
      Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Romance, however,’ Flora went on, busily arranging Mr F.‘s Aunt’s toast,
      ‘as I openly said to Mr F. when he proposed to me and you will be
      surprised to hear that he proposed seven times once in a hackney-coach
      once in a boat once in a pew once on a donkey at Tunbridge Wells and the
      rest on his knees, Romance was fled with the early days of Arthur Clennam,
      our parents tore us asunder we became marble and stern reality usurped the
      throne, Mr F. said very much to his credit that he was perfectly aware of
      it and even preferred that state of things accordingly the word was spoken
      the fiat went forth and such is life you see my dear and yet we do not
      break but bend, pray make a good breakfast while I go in with the tray.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared, leaving Little Dorrit to ponder over the meaning of her
      scattered words. She soon came back again; and at last began to take her
      own breakfast, talking all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You see, my dear,’ said Flora, measuring out a spoonful or two of some
      brown liquid that smelt like brandy, and putting it into her tea, ‘I am
      obliged to be careful to follow the directions of my medical man though
      the flavour is anything but agreeable being a poor creature and it may be
      have never recovered the shock received in youth from too much giving way
      to crying in the next room when separated from Arthur, have you known him
      long?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Little Dorrit comprehended that she had been asked this
      question—for which time was necessary, the galloping pace of her new
      patroness having left her far behind—she answered that she had known
      Mr Clennam ever since his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To be sure you couldn’t have known him before unless you had been in
      China or had corresponded neither of which is likely,’ returned Flora,
      ‘for travelling-people usually get more or less mahogany and you are not
      at all so and as to corresponding what about? that’s very true unless tea,
      so it was at his mother’s was it really that you knew him first, highly
      sensible and firm but dreadfully severe—ought to be the mother of
      the man in the iron mask.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Clennam has been kind to me,’ said Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really? I am sure I am glad to hear it because as Arthur’s mother it’s
      naturally pleasant to my feelings to have a better opinion of her than I
      had before, though what she thinks of me when I run on as I am certain to
      do and she sits glowering at me like Fate in a go-cart—shocking
      comparison really—invalid and not her fault—I never know or
      can imagine.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Shall I find my work anywhere, ma’am?’ asked Little Dorrit, looking
      timidly about; ‘can I get it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You industrious little fairy,’ returned Flora, taking, in another cup of
      tea, another of the doses prescribed by her medical man, ‘there’s not the
      slightest hurry and it’s better that we should begin by being confidential
      about our mutual friend—too cold a word for me at least I don’t mean
      that, very proper expression mutual friend—than become through mere
      formalities not you but me like the Spartan boy with the fox biting him,
      which I hope you’ll excuse my bringing up for of all the tiresome boys
      that will go tumbling into every sort of company that boy’s the
      tiresomest.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit, her face very pale, sat down again to listen. ‘Hadn’t I
      better work the while?’ she asked. ‘I can work and attend too. I would
      rather, if I may.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her earnestness was so expressive of her being uneasy without her work,
      that Flora answered, ‘Well my dear whatever you like best,’ and produced a
      basket of white handkerchiefs. Little Dorrit gladly put it by her side,
      took out her little pocket-housewife, threaded the needle, and began to
      hem.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What nimble fingers you have,’ said Flora, ‘but are you sure you are
      well?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh yes, indeed!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora put her feet upon the fender, and settled herself for a thorough
      good romantic disclosure. She started off at score, tossing her head,
      sighing in the most demonstrative manner, making a great deal of use of
      her eyebrows, and occasionally, but not often, glancing at the quiet face
      that bent over the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You must know my dear,’ said Flora, ‘but that I have no doubt you know
      already not only because I have already thrown it out in a general way but
      because I feel I carry it stamped in burning what’s his names upon my brow
      that before I was introduced to the late Mr F. I had been engaged to
      Arthur Clennam—Mr Clennam in public where reserve is necessary
      Arthur here—we were all in all to one another it was the morning of
      life it was bliss it was frenzy it was everything else of that sort in the
      highest degree, when rent asunder we turned to stone in which capacity
      Arthur went to China and I became the statue bride of the late Mr F.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora, uttering these words in a deep voice, enjoyed herself immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To paint,’ said she, ‘the emotions of that morning when all was marble
      within and Mr F.‘s Aunt followed in a glass-coach which it stands to
      reason must have been in shameful repair or it never could have broken
      down two streets from the house and Mr F.‘s Aunt brought home like the
      fifth of November in a rush-bottomed chair I will not attempt, suffice it
      to say that the hollow form of breakfast took place in the dining-room
      downstairs that papa partaking too freely of pickled salmon was ill for
      weeks and that Mr F. and myself went upon a continental tour to Calais
      where the people fought for us on the pier until they separated us though
      not for ever that was not yet to be.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The statue bride, hardly pausing for breath, went on, with the greatest
      complacency, in a rambling manner sometimes incidental to flesh and blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I will draw a veil over that dreamy life, Mr F. was in good spirits his
      appetite was good he liked the cookery he considered the wine weak but
      palatable and all was well, we returned to the immediate neighbourhood of
      Number Thirty Little Gosling Street London Docks and settled down, ere we
      had yet fully detected the housemaid in selling the feathers out of the
      spare bed Gout flying upwards soared with Mr F. to another sphere.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His relict, with a glance at his portrait, shook her head and wiped her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I revere the memory of Mr F. as an estimable man and most indulgent
      husband, only necessary to mention Asparagus and it appeared or to hint at
      any little delicate thing to drink and it came like magic in a pint bottle
      it was not ecstasy but it was comfort, I returned to papa’s roof and lived
      secluded if not happy during some years until one day papa came smoothly
      blundering in and said that Arthur Clennam awaited me below, I went below
      and found him ask me not what I found him except that he was still
      unmarried still unchanged!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark mystery with which Flora now enshrouded herself might have
      stopped other fingers than the nimble fingers that worked near her. They
      worked on without pause, and the busy head bent over them watching the
      stitches.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ask me not,’ said Flora, ‘if I love him still or if he still loves me or
      what the end is to be or when, we are surrounded by watchful eyes and it
      may be that we are destined to pine asunder it may be never more to be
      reunited not a word not a breath not a look to betray us all must be
      secret as the tomb wonder not therefore that even if I should seem
      comparatively cold to Arthur or Arthur should seem comparatively cold to
      me we have fatal reasons it is enough if we understand them hush!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which Flora said with so much headlong vehemence as if she really
      believed it. There is not much doubt that when she worked herself into
      full mermaid condition, she did actually believe whatever she said in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush!’ repeated Flora, ‘I have now told you all, confidence is
      established between us hush, for Arthur’s sake I will always be a friend
      to you my dear girl and in Arthur’s name you may always rely upon me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The nimble fingers laid aside the work, and the little figure rose and
      kissed her hand. ‘You are very cold,’ said Flora, changing to her own
      natural kind-hearted manner, and gaining greatly by the change. ‘Don’t
      work to-day. I am sure you are not well I am sure you are not strong.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is only that I feel a little overcome by your kindness, and by Mr
      Clennam’s kindness in confiding me to one he has known and loved so long.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well really my dear,’ said Flora, who had a decided tendency to be always
      honest when she gave herself time to think about it, ‘it’s as well to
      leave that alone now, for I couldn’t undertake to say after all, but it
      doesn’t signify lie down a little!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have always been strong enough to do what I want to do, and I shall be
      quite well directly,’ returned Little Dorrit, with a faint smile. ‘You
      have overpowered me with gratitude, that’s all. If I keep near the window
      for a moment I shall be quite myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora opened a window, sat her in a chair by it, and considerately retired
      to her former place. It was a windy day, and the air stirring on Little
      Dorrit’s face soon brightened it. In a very few minutes she returned to
      her basket of work, and her nimble fingers were as nimble as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quietly pursuing her task, she asked Flora if Mr Clennam had told her
      where she lived? When Flora replied in the negative, Little Dorrit said
      that she understood why he had been so delicate, but that she felt sure he
      would approve of her confiding her secret to Flora, and that she would
      therefore do so now with Flora’s permission. Receiving an encouraging
      answer, she condensed the narrative of her life into a few scanty words
      about herself and a glowing eulogy upon her father; and Flora took it all
      in with a natural tenderness that quite understood it, and in which there
      was no incoherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner-time came, Flora drew the arm of her new charge through hers,
      and led her down-stairs, and presented her to the Patriarch and Mr Pancks,
      who were already in the dining-room waiting to begin. (Mr F.‘s Aunt was,
      for the time, laid up in ordinary in her chamber.) By those gentlemen she
      was received according to their characters; the Patriarch appearing to do
      her some inestimable service in saying that he was glad to see her, glad
      to see her; and Mr Pancks blowing off his favourite sound as a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that new presence she would have been bashful enough under any
      circumstances, and particularly under Flora’s insisting on her drinking a
      glass of wine and eating of the best that was there; but her constraint
      was greatly increased by Mr Pancks. The demeanour of that gentleman at
      first suggested to her mind that he might be a taker of likenesses, so
      intently did he look at her, and so frequently did he glance at the little
      note-book by his side. Observing that he made no sketch, however, and that
      he talked about business only, she began to have suspicions that he
      represented some creditor of her father’s, the balance due to whom was
      noted in that pocket volume. Regarded from this point of view Mr Pancks’s
      puffings expressed injury and impatience, and each of his louder snorts
      became a demand for payment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here again she was undeceived by anomalous and incongruous conduct on
      the part of Mr Pancks himself. She had left the table half an hour, and
      was at work alone. Flora had ‘gone to lie down’ in the next room,
      concurrently with which retirement a smell of something to drink had
      broken out in the house. The Patriarch was fast asleep, with his
      philanthropic mouth open under a yellow pocket-handkerchief in the
      dining-room. At this quiet time, Mr Pancks softly appeared before her,
      urbanely nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Find it a little dull, Miss Dorrit?’ inquired Pancks in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, thank you, sir,’ said Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Busy, I see,’ observed Mr Pancks, stealing into the room by inches. ‘What
      are those now, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Handkerchiefs.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are they, though!’ said Pancks. ‘I shouldn’t have thought it.’ Not in the
      least looking at them, but looking at Little Dorrit. ‘Perhaps you wonder
      who I am. Shall I tell you? I am a fortune-teller.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit now began to think he was mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I belong body and soul to my proprietor,’ said Pancks; ‘you saw my
      proprietor having his dinner below. But I do a little in the other way,
      sometimes; privately, very privately, Miss Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit looked at him doubtfully, and not without alarm. ‘I wish
      you’d show me the palm of your hand,’ said Pancks. ‘I should like to have
      a look at it. Don’t let me be troublesome.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so far troublesome that he was not at all wanted there, but she
      laid her work in her lap for a moment, and held out her left hand with her
      thimble on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Years of toil, eh?’ said Pancks, softly, touching it with his blunt
      forefinger. ‘But what else are we made for? Nothing. Hallo!’ looking into
      the lines. ‘What’s this with bars? It’s a College! And what’s this with a
      grey gown and a black velvet cap? it’s a father! And what’s this with a
      clarionet? It’s an uncle! And what’s this in dancing-shoes? It’s a sister!
      And what’s this straggling about in an idle sort of a way? It’s a brother!
      And what’s this thinking for ‘em all? Why, this is you, Miss Dorrit!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes met his as she looked up wonderingly into his face, and she
      thought that although his were sharp eyes, he was a brighter and
      gentler-looking man than she had supposed at dinner. His eyes were on her
      hand again directly, and her opportunity of confirming or correcting the
      impression was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, the deuce is in it,’ muttered Pancks, tracing out a line in her hand
      with his clumsy finger, ‘if this isn’t me in the corner here! What do I
      want here? What’s behind me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried his finger slowly down to the wrist, and round the wrist, and
      affected to look at the back of the hand for what was behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it any harm?’ asked Little Dorrit, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Deuce a bit!’ said Pancks. ‘What do you think it’s worth?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I ought to ask you that. I am not the fortune-teller.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True,’ said Pancks. ‘What’s it worth? You shall live to see, Miss
      Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Releasing the hand by slow degrees, he drew all his fingers through his
      prongs of hair, so that they stood up in their most portentous manner; and
      repeated slowly, ‘Remember what I say, Miss Dorrit. You shall live to
      see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not help showing that she was much surprised, if it were only by
      his knowing so much about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! That’s it!’ said Pancks, pointing at her. ‘Miss Dorrit, not that,
      ever!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      More surprised than before, and a little more frightened, she looked to
      him for an explanation of his last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not that,’ said Pancks, making, with great seriousness, an imitation of a
      surprised look and manner that appeared to be unintentionally grotesque.
      ‘Don’t do that. Never on seeing me, no matter when, no matter where. I am
      nobody. Don’t take on to mind me. Don’t mention me. Take no notice. Will
      you agree, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hardly know what to say,’ returned Little Dorrit, quite astounded.
      ‘Why?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because I am a fortune-teller. Pancks the gipsy. I haven’t told you so
      much of your fortune yet, Miss Dorrit, as to tell you what’s behind me on
      that little hand. I have told you you shall live to see. Is it agreed,
      Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Agreed that I—am—to—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To take no notice of me away from here, unless I take on first. Not to
      mind me when I come and go. It’s very easy. I am no loss, I am not
      handsome, I am not good company, I am only my proprietors grubber. You
      need do no more than think, “Ah! Pancks the gipsy at his fortune-telling—he’ll
      tell the rest of my fortune one day—I shall live to know it.” Is it
      agreed, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ye-es,’ faltered Little Dorrit, whom he greatly confused, ‘I suppose so,
      while you do no harm.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good!’ Mr Pancks glanced at the wall of the adjoining room, and stooped
      forward. ‘Honest creature, woman of capital points, but heedless and a
      loose talker, Miss Dorrit.’ With that he rubbed his hands as if the
      interview had been very satisfactory to him, panted away to the door, and
      urbanely nodded himself out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Little Dorrit were beyond measure perplexed by this curious conduct on
      the part of her new acquaintance, and by finding herself involved in this
      singular treaty, her perplexity was not diminished by ensuing
      circumstances. Besides that Mr Pancks took every opportunity afforded him
      in Mr Casby’s house of significantly glancing at her and snorting at her—which
      was not much, after what he had done already—he began to pervade her
      daily life. She saw him in the street, constantly. When she went to Mr
      Casby’s, he was always there. When she went to Mrs Clennam’s, he came
      there on any pretence, as if to keep her in his sight. A week had not gone
      by, when she found him to her astonishment in the Lodge one night,
      conversing with the turnkey on duty, and to all appearance one of his
      familiar companions. Her next surprise was to find him equally at his ease
      within the prison; to hear of his presenting himself among the visitors at
      her father’s Sunday levee; to see him arm in arm with a Collegiate friend
      about the yard; to learn, from Fame, that he had greatly distinguished
      himself one evening at the social club that held its meetings in the
      Snuggery, by addressing a speech to the members of the institution,
      singing a song, and treating the company to five gallons of ale—report
      madly added a bushel of shrimps. The effect on Mr Plornish of such of
      these phenomena as he became an eye-witness of in his faithful visits,
      made an impression on Little Dorrit only second to that produced by the
      phenomena themselves. They seemed to gag and bind him. He could only
      stare, and sometimes weakly mutter that it wouldn’t be believed down
      Bleeding Heart Yard that this was Pancks; but he never said a word more,
      or made a sign more, even to Little Dorrit. Mr Pancks crowned his
      mysteries by making himself acquainted with Tip in some unknown manner,
      and taking a Sunday saunter into the College on that gentleman’s arm.
      Throughout he never took any notice of Little Dorrit, save once or twice
      when he happened to come close to her and there was no one very near; on
      which occasions, he said in passing, with a friendly look and a puff of
      encouragement, ‘Pancks the gipsy—fortune-telling.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit worked and strove as usual, wondering at all this, but
      keeping her wonder, as she had from her earliest years kept many heavier
      loads, in her own breast. A change had stolen, and was stealing yet, over
      the patient heart. Every day found her something more retiring than the
      day before. To pass in and out of the prison unnoticed, and elsewhere to
      be overlooked and forgotten, were, for herself, her chief desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her own room too, strangely assorted room for her delicate youth and
      character, she was glad to retreat as often as she could without desertion
      of any duty. There were afternoon times when she was unemployed, when
      visitors dropped in to play a hand at cards with her father, when she
      could be spared and was better away. Then she would flit along the yard,
      climb the scores of stairs that led to her room, and take her seat at the
      window. Many combinations did those spikes upon the wall assume, many
      light shapes did the strong iron weave itself into, many golden touches
      fell upon the rust, while Little Dorrit sat there musing. New zig-zags
      sprung into the cruel pattern sometimes, when she saw it through a burst
      of tears; but beautified or hardened still, always over it and under it
      and through it, she was fain to look in her solitude, seeing everything
      with that ineffaceable brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A garret, and a Marshalsea garret without compromise, was Little Dorrit’s
      room. Beautifully kept, it was ugly in itself, and had little but
      cleanliness and air to set it off; for what embellishment she had ever
      been able to buy, had gone to her father’s room. Howbeit, for this poor
      place she showed an increasing love; and to sit in it alone became her
      favourite rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Insomuch, that on a certain afternoon during the Pancks mysteries, when
      she was seated at her window, and heard Maggy’s well-known step coming up
      the stairs, she was very much disturbed by the apprehension of being
      summoned away. As Maggy’s step came higher up and nearer, she trembled and
      faltered; and it was as much as she could do to speak, when Maggy at
      length appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Please, Little Mother,’ said Maggy, panting for breath, ‘you must come
      down and see him. He’s here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who, Maggy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who, o’ course Mr Clennam. He’s in your father’s room, and he says to me,
      Maggy, will you be so kind and go and say it’s only me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am not very well, Maggy. I had better not go. I am going to lie down.
      See! I lie down now, to ease my head. Say, with my grateful regard, that
      you left me so, or I would have come.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, it an’t very polite though, Little Mother,’ said the staring Maggy,
      ‘to turn your face away, neither!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maggy was very susceptible to personal slights, and very ingenious in
      inventing them. ‘Putting both your hands afore your face too!’ she went
      on. ‘If you can’t bear the looks of a poor thing, it would be better to
      tell her so at once, and not go and shut her out like that, hurting her
      feelings and breaking her heart at ten year old, poor thing!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s to ease my head, Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, and if you cry to ease your head, Little Mother, let me cry too.
      Don’t go and have all the crying to yourself,’ expostulated Maggy, ‘that
      an’t not being greedy.’ And immediately began to blubber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with some difficulty that she could be induced to go back with the
      excuse; but the promise of being told a story—of old her great
      delight—on condition that she concentrated her faculties upon the
      errand and left her little mistress to herself for an hour longer,
      combined with a misgiving on Maggy’s part that she had left her good
      temper at the bottom of the staircase, prevailed. So away she went,
      muttering her message all the way to keep it in her mind, and, at the
      appointed time, came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He was very sorry, I can tell you,’ she announced, ‘and wanted to send a
      doctor. And he’s coming again to-morrow he is and I don’t think he’ll have
      a good sleep to-night along o’ hearing about your head, Little Mother. Oh
      my! Ain’t you been a-crying!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think I have, a little, Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A little! Oh!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it’s all over now—all over for good, Maggy. And my head is much
      better and cooler, and I am quite comfortable. I am very glad I did not go
      down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her great staring child tenderly embraced her; and having smoothed her
      hair, and bathed her forehead and eyes with cold water (offices in which
      her awkward hands became skilful), hugged her again, exulted in her
      brighter looks, and stationed her in her chair by the window. Over against
      this chair, Maggy, with apoplectic exertions that were not at all
      required, dragged the box which was her seat on story-telling occasions,
      sat down upon it, hugged her own knees, and said, with a voracious
      appetite for stories, and with widely-opened eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, Little Mother, let’s have a good ‘un!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What shall it be about, Maggy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, let’s have a princess,’ said Maggy, ‘and let her be a reg’lar one.
      Beyond all belief, you know!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit considered for a moment; and with a rather sad smile upon
      her face, which was flushed by the sunset, began:
    </p>

      <a href="images/0266.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      ‘Maggy, there was once upon a time a fine King, and he had everything he
      could wish for, and a great deal more. He had gold and silver, diamonds
      and rubies, riches of every kind. He had palaces, and he had—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hospitals,’ interposed Maggy, still nursing her knees. ‘Let him have
      hospitals, because they’re so comfortable. Hospitals with lots of
      Chicking.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, he had plenty of them, and he had plenty of everything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Plenty of baked potatoes, for instance?’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Plenty of everything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lor!’ chuckled Maggy, giving her knees a hug. ‘Wasn’t it prime!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This King had a daughter, who was the wisest and most beautiful Princess
      that ever was seen. When she was a child she understood all her lessons
      before her masters taught them to her; and when she was grown up, she was
      the wonder of the world. Now, near the Palace where this Princess lived,
      there was a cottage in which there was a poor little tiny woman, who lived
      all alone by herself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An old woman,’ said Maggy, with an unctuous smack of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, not an old woman. Quite a young one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I wonder she warn’t afraid,’ said Maggy. ‘Go on, please.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Princess passed the cottage nearly every day, and whenever she went
      by in her beautiful carriage, she saw the poor tiny woman spinning at her
      wheel, and she looked at the tiny woman, and the tiny woman looked at her.
      So, one day she stopped the coachman a little way from the cottage, and
      got out and walked on and peeped in at the door, and there, as usual, was
      the tiny woman spinning at her wheel, and she looked at the Princess, and
      the Princess looked at her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Like trying to stare one another out,’ said Maggy. ‘Please go on, Little
      Mother.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Princess was such a wonderful Princess that she had the power of
      knowing secrets, and she said to the tiny woman, Why do you keep it there?
      This showed her directly that the Princess knew why she lived all alone by
      herself spinning at her wheel, and she kneeled down at the Princess’s
      feet, and asked her never to betray her. So the Princess said, I never
      will betray you. Let me see it. So the tiny woman closed the shutter of
      the cottage window and fastened the door, and trembling from head to foot
      for fear that any one should suspect her, opened a very secret place and
      showed the Princess a shadow.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lor!’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It was the shadow of Some one who had gone by long before: of Some one
      who had gone on far away quite out of reach, never, never to come back. It
      was bright to look at; and when the tiny woman showed it to the Princess,
      she was proud of it with all her heart, as a great, great treasure. When
      the Princess had considered it a little while, she said to the tiny woman,
      And you keep watch over this every day? And she cast down her eyes, and
      whispered, Yes. Then the Princess said, Remind me why. To which the other
      replied, that no one so good and kind had ever passed that way, and that
      was why in the beginning. She said, too, that nobody missed it, that
      nobody was the worse for it, that Some one had gone on, to those who were
      expecting him—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Some one was a man then?’ interposed Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit timidly said Yes, she believed so; and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—Had gone on to those who were expecting him, and that this
      remembrance was stolen or kept back from nobody. The Princess made answer,
      Ah! But when the cottager died it would be discovered there. The tiny
      woman told her No; when that time came, it would sink quietly into her own
      grave, and would never be found.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, to be sure!’ said Maggy. ‘Go on, please.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Princess was very much astonished to hear this, as you may suppose,
      Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (‘And well she might be,’ said Maggy.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So she resolved to watch the tiny woman, and see what came of it. Every
      day she drove in her beautiful carriage by the cottage-door, and there she
      saw the tiny woman always alone by herself spinning at her wheel, and she
      looked at the tiny woman, and the tiny woman looked at her. At last one
      day the wheel was still, and the tiny woman was not to be seen. When the
      Princess made inquiries why the wheel had stopped, and where the tiny
      woman was, she was informed that the wheel had stopped because there was
      nobody to turn it, the tiny woman being dead.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (‘They ought to have took her to the Hospital,’ said Maggy, and then she’d
      have got over it.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Princess, after crying a very little for the loss of the tiny woman,
      dried her eyes and got out of her carriage at the place where she had
      stopped it before, and went to the cottage and peeped in at the door.
      There was nobody to look at her now, and nobody for her to look at, so she
      went in at once to search for the treasured shadow. But there was no sign
      of it to be found anywhere; and then she knew that the tiny woman had told
      her the truth, and that it would never give anybody any trouble, and that
      it had sunk quietly into her own grave, and that she and it were at rest
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s all, Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunset flush was so bright on Little Dorrit’s face when she came thus
      to the end of her story, that she interposed her hand to shade it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Had she got to be old?’ Maggy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The tiny woman?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘But it would have been just the same
      if she had been ever so old.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Would it raly!’ said Maggy. ‘Well, I suppose it would though.’ And sat
      staring and ruminating.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat so long with her eyes wide open, that at length Little Dorrit, to
      entice her from her box, rose and looked out of window. As she glanced
      down into the yard, she saw Pancks come in and leer up with the corner of
      his eye as he went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who’s he, Little Mother?’ said Maggy. She had joined her at the window
      and was leaning on her shoulder. ‘I see him come in and out often.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have heard him called a fortune-teller,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘But I
      doubt if he could tell many people even their past or present fortunes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Couldn’t have told the Princess hers?’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit, looking musingly down into the dark valley of the prison,
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nor the tiny woman hers?’ said Maggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ said Little Dorrit, with the sunset very bright upon her. ‘But let
      us come away from the window.’

<p>The private residence of Mr Pancks was in Pentonville, where he lodged on
      the second-floor of a professional gentleman in an extremely small way,
      who had an inner-door within the street door, poised on a spring and
      starting open with a click like a trap; and who wrote up in the fan-light,
      RUGG, GENERAL AGENT, ACCOUNTANT, DEBTS RECOVERED.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scroll, majestic in its severe simplicity, illuminated a little slip
      of front garden abutting on the thirsty high-road, where a few of the
      dustiest of leaves hung their dismal heads and led a life of choking. A
      professor of writing occupied the first-floor, and enlivened the garden
      railings with glass-cases containing choice examples of what his pupils
      had been before six lessons and while the whole of his young family shook
      the table, and what they had become after six lessons when the young
      family was under restraint. The tenancy of Mr Pancks was limited to one
      airy bedroom; he covenanting and agreeing with Mr Rugg his landlord, that
      in consideration of a certain scale of payments accurately defined, and on
      certain verbal notice duly given, he should be at liberty to elect to
      share the Sunday breakfast, dinner, tea, or supper, or each or any or all
      of those repasts or meals of Mr and Miss Rugg (his daughter) in the
      back-parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rugg was a lady of a little property which she had acquired, together
      with much distinction in the neighbourhood, by having her heart severely
      lacerated and her feelings mangled by a middle-aged baker resident in the
      vicinity, against whom she had, by the agency of Mr Rugg, found it
      necessary to proceed at law to recover damages for a breach of promise of
      marriage. The baker having been, by the counsel for Miss Rugg, witheringly
      denounced on that occasion up to the full amount of twenty guineas, at the
      rate of about eighteen-pence an epithet, and having been cast in
      corresponding damages, still suffered occasional persecution from the
      youth of Pentonville. But Miss Rugg, environed by the majesty of the law,
      and having her damages invested in the public securities, was regarded
      with consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the society of Mr Rugg, who had a round white visage, as if all his
      blushes had been drawn out of him long ago, and who had a ragged yellow
      head like a worn-out hearth broom; and in the society of Miss Rugg, who
      had little nankeen spots, like shirt buttons, all over her face, and whose
      own yellow tresses were rather scrubby than luxuriant; Mr Pancks had
      usually dined on Sundays for some few years, and had twice a week, or so,
      enjoyed an evening collation of bread, Dutch cheese, and porter. Mr Pancks
      was one of the very few marriageable men for whom Miss Rugg had no
      terrors, the argument with which he reassured himself being twofold; that
      is to say, firstly, ‘that it wouldn’t do twice,’ and secondly, ‘that he
      wasn’t worth it.’ Fortified within this double armour, Mr Pancks snorted
      at Miss Rugg on easy terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to this time, Mr Pancks had transacted little or no business at his
      quarters in Pentonville, except in the sleeping line; but now that he had
      become a fortune-teller, he was often closeted after midnight with Mr Rugg
      in his little front-parlour office, and even after those untimely hours,
      burnt tallow in his bed-room. Though his duties as his proprietor’s
      grubber were in no wise lessened; and though that service bore no greater
      resemblance to a bed of roses than was to be discovered in its many
      thorns; some new branch of industry made a constant demand upon him. When
      he cast off the Patriarch at night, it was only to take an anonymous craft
      in tow, and labour away afresh in other waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advance from a personal acquaintance with the elder Mr Chivery to an
      introduction to his amiable wife and disconsolate son, may have been easy;
      but easy or not, Mr Pancks soon made it. He nestled in the bosom of the
      tobacco business within a week or two after his first appearance in the
      College, and particularly addressed himself to the cultivation of a good
      understanding with Young John. In this endeavour he so prospered as to
      lure that pining shepherd forth from the groves, and tempt him to
      undertake mysterious missions; on which he began to disappear at uncertain
      intervals for as long a space as two or three days together. The prudent
      Mrs Chivery, who wondered greatly at this change, would have protested
      against it as detrimental to the Highland typification on the doorpost but
      for two forcible reasons; one, that her John was roused to take strong
      interest in the business which these starts were supposed to advance—and
      this she held to be good for his drooping spirits; the other, that Mr
      Pancks confidentially agreed to pay her, for the occupation of her son’s
      time, at the handsome rate of seven and sixpence per day. The proposal
      originated with himself, and was couched in the pithy terms, ‘If your John
      is weak enough, ma’am, not to take it, that is no reason why you should
      be, don’t you see? So, quite between ourselves, ma’am, business being
      business, here it is!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      What Mr Chivery thought of these things, or how much or how little he knew
      about them, was never gathered from himself. It has been already remarked
      that he was a man of few words; and it may be here observed that he had
      imbibed a professional habit of locking everything up. He locked himself
      up as carefully as he locked up the Marshalsea debtors. Even his custom of
      bolting his meals may have been a part of an uniform whole; but there is
      no question, that, as to all other purposes, he kept his mouth as he kept
      the Marshalsea door. He never opened it without occasion. When it was
      necessary to let anything out, he opened it a little way, held it open
      just as long as sufficed for the purpose, and locked it again. Even as he
      would be sparing of his trouble at the Marshalsea door, and would keep a
      visitor who wanted to go out, waiting for a few moments if he saw another
      visitor coming down the yard, so that one turn of the key should suffice
      for both, similarly he would often reserve a remark if he perceived
      another on its way to his lips, and would deliver himself of the two
      together. As to any key to his inner knowledge being to be found in his
      face, the Marshalsea key was as legible as an index to the individual
      characters and histories upon which it was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mr Pancks should be moved to invite any one to dinner at Pentonville,
      was an unprecedented fact in his calendar. But he invited Young John to
      dinner, and even brought him within range of the dangerous (because
      expensive) fascinations of Miss Rugg. The banquet was appointed for a
      Sunday, and Miss Rugg with her own hands stuffed a leg of mutton with
      oysters on the occasion, and sent it to the baker’s—not <i>the</i>
      baker’s but an opposition establishment. Provision of oranges, apples, and
      nuts was also made. And rum was brought home by Mr Pancks on Saturday
      night, to gladden the visitor’s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The store of creature comforts was not the chief part of the visitor’s
      reception. Its special feature was a foregone family confidence and
      sympathy. When Young John appeared at half-past one without the ivory hand
      and waistcoat of golden sprigs, the sun shorn of his beams by disastrous
      clouds, Mr Pancks presented him to the yellow-haired Ruggs as the young
      man he had so often mentioned who loved Miss Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am glad,’ said Mr Rugg, challenging him specially in that character,
      ‘to have the distinguished gratification of making your acquaintance, sir.
      Your feelings do you honour. You are young; may you never outlive your
      feelings! If I was to outlive my own feelings, sir,’ said Mr Rugg, who was
      a man of many words, and was considered to possess a remarkably good
      address; ‘if I was to outlive my own feelings, I’d leave fifty pound in my
      will to the man who would put me out of existence.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rugg heaved a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My daughter, sir,’ said Mr Rugg. ‘Anastatia, you are no stranger to the
      state of this young man’s affections. My daughter has had her trials, sir’—Mr
      Rugg might have used the word more pointedly in the singular number—‘and
      she can feel for you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John, almost overwhelmed by the touching nature of this greeting,
      professed himself to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What I envy you, sir, is,’ said Mr Rugg, ‘allow me to take your hat—we
      are rather short of pegs—I’ll put it in the corner, nobody will
      tread on it there—What I envy you, sir, is the luxury of your own
      feelings. I belong to a profession in which that luxury is sometimes
      denied us.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John replied, with acknowledgments, that he only hoped he did what
      was right, and what showed how entirely he was devoted to Miss Dorrit. He
      wished to be unselfish; and he hoped he was. He wished to do anything as
      laid in his power to serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of
      sight; and he hoped he did. It was but little that he could do, but he
      hoped he did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sir,’ said Mr Rugg, taking him by the hand, ‘you are a young man that it
      does one good to come across. You are a young man that I should like to
      put in the witness-box, to humanise the minds of the legal profession. I
      hope you have brought your appetite with you, and intend to play a good
      knife and fork?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir,’ returned Young John, ‘I don’t eat much at present.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Rugg drew him a little apart. ‘My daughter’s case, sir,’ said he, ‘at
      the time when, in vindication of her outraged feelings and her sex, she
      became the plaintiff in Rugg and Bawkins. I suppose I could have put it in
      evidence, Mr Chivery, if I had thought it worth my while, that the amount
      of solid sustenance my daughter consumed at that period did not exceed ten
      ounces per week.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think I go a little beyond that, sir,’ returned the other, hesitating,
      as if he confessed it with some shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But in your case there’s no fiend in human form,’ said Mr Rugg, with
      argumentative smile and action of hand. ‘Observe, Mr Chivery! No fiend in
      human form!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, certainly,’ Young John added with simplicity, ‘I should be very
      sorry if there was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The sentiment,’ said Mr Rugg, ‘is what I should have expected from your
      known principles. It would affect my daughter greatly, sir, if she heard
      it. As I perceive the mutton, I am glad she didn’t hear it. Mr Pancks, on
      this occasion, pray face me. My dear, face Mr Chivery. For what we are
      going to receive, may we (and Miss Dorrit) be truly thankful!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But for a grave waggishness in Mr Rugg’s manner of delivering this
      introduction to the feast, it might have appeared that Miss Dorrit was
      expected to be one of the company. Pancks recognised the sally in his
      usual way, and took in his provender in his usual way. Miss Rugg, perhaps
      making up some of her arrears, likewise took very kindly to the mutton,
      and it rapidly diminished to the bone. A bread-and-butter pudding entirely
      disappeared, and a considerable amount of cheese and radishes vanished by
      the same means. Then came the dessert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then also, and before the broaching of the rum and water, came Mr Pancks’s
      note-book. The ensuing business proceedings were brief but curious, and
      rather in the nature of a conspiracy. Mr Pancks looked over his note-book,
      which was now getting full, studiously; and picked out little extracts,
      which he wrote on separate slips of paper on the table; Mr Rugg, in the
      meanwhile, looking at him with close attention, and Young John losing his
      uncollected eye in mists of meditation. When Mr Pancks, who supported the
      character of chief conspirator, had completed his extracts, he looked them
      over, corrected them, put up his note-book, and held them like a hand at
      cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, there’s a churchyard in Bedfordshire,’ said Pancks. ‘Who takes it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I’ll take it, sir,’ returned Mr Rugg, ‘if no one bids.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks dealt him his card, and looked at his hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, there’s an Enquiry in York,’ said Pancks. ‘Who takes it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I’m not good for York,’ said Mr Rugg.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then perhaps,’ pursued Pancks, ‘you’ll be so obliging, John Chivery?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Young John assenting, Pancks dealt him his card, and consulted his hand
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There’s a Church in London; I may as well take that. And a Family Bible;
      I may as well take that, too. That’s two to me. Two to me,’ repeated
      Pancks, breathing hard over his cards. ‘Here’s a Clerk at Durham for you,
      John, and an old seafaring gentleman at Dunstable for you, Mr Rugg. Two to
      me, was it? Yes, two to me. Here’s a Stone; three to me. And a Still-born
      Baby; four to me. And all, for the present, told.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had thus disposed of his cards, all being done very quietly and in
      a suppressed tone, Mr Pancks puffed his way into his own breast-pocket and
      tugged out a canvas bag; from which, with a sparing hand, he told forth
      money for travelling expenses in two little portions. ‘Cash goes out
      fast,’ he said anxiously, as he pushed a portion to each of his male
      companions, ‘very fast.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can only assure you, Mr Pancks,’ said Young John, ‘that I deeply regret
      my circumstances being such that I can’t afford to pay my own charges, or
      that it’s not advisable to allow me the time necessary for my doing the
      distances on foot; because nothing would give me greater satisfaction than
      to walk myself off my legs without fee or reward.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man’s disinterestedness appeared so very ludicrous in the eyes
      of Miss Rugg, that she was obliged to effect a precipitate retirement from
      the company, and to sit upon the stairs until she had had her laugh out.
      Meanwhile Mr Pancks, looking, not without some pity, at Young John, slowly
      and thoughtfully twisted up his canvas bag as if he were wringing its
      neck. The lady, returning as he restored it to his pocket, mixed rum and
      water for the party, not forgetting her fair self, and handed to every one
      his glass. When all were supplied, Mr Rugg rose, and silently holding out
      his glass at arm’s length above the centre of the table, by that gesture
      invited the other three to add theirs, and to unite in a general
      conspiratorial clink. The ceremony was effective up to a certain point,
      and would have been wholly so throughout, if Miss Rugg, as she raised her
      glass to her lips in completion of it, had not happened to look at Young
      John; when she was again so overcome by the contemptible comicality of his
      disinterestedness as to splutter some ambrosial drops of rum and water
      around, and withdraw in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the dinner without precedent, given by Pancks at Pentonville; and
      such was the busy and strange life Pancks led. The only waking moments at
      which he appeared to relax from his cares, and to recreate himself by
      going anywhere or saying anything without a pervading object, were when he
      showed a dawning interest in the lame foreigner with the stick, down
      Bleeding Heart Yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreigner, by name John Baptist Cavalletto—they called him Mr
      Baptist in the Yard—was such a chirping, easy, hopeful little
      fellow, that his attraction for Pancks was probably in the force of
      contrast. Solitary, weak, and scantily acquainted with the most necessary
      words of the only language in which he could communicate with the people
      about him, he went with the stream of his fortunes, in a brisk way that
      was new in those parts. With little to eat, and less to drink, and nothing
      to wear but what he wore upon him, or had brought tied up in one of the
      smallest bundles that ever were seen, he put as bright a face upon it as
      if he were in the most flourishing circumstances when he first hobbled up
      and down the Yard, humbly propitiating the general good-will with his
      white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was uphill work for a foreigner, lame or sound, to make his way with
      the Bleeding Hearts. In the first place, they were vaguely persuaded that
      every foreigner had a knife about him; in the second, they held it to be a
      sound constitutional national axiom that he ought to go home to his own
      country. They never thought of inquiring how many of their own countrymen
      would be returned upon their hands from divers parts of the world, if the
      principle were generally recognised; they considered it particularly and
      peculiarly British. In the third place, they had a notion that it was a
      sort of Divine visitation upon a foreigner that he was not an Englishman,
      and that all kinds of calamities happened to his country because it did
      things that England did not, and did not do things that England did. In
      this belief, to be sure, they had long been carefully trained by the
      Barnacles and Stiltstalkings, who were always proclaiming to them,
      officially, that no country which failed to submit itself to those two
      large families could possibly hope to be under the protection of
      Providence; and who, when they believed it, disparaged them in private as
      the most prejudiced people under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, therefore, might be called a political position of the Bleeding
      Hearts; but they entertained other objections to having foreigners in the
      Yard. They believed that foreigners were always badly off; and though they
      were as ill off themselves as they could desire to be, that did not
      diminish the force of the objection. They believed that foreigners were
      dragooned and bayoneted; and though they certainly got their own skulls
      promptly fractured if they showed any ill-humour, still it was with a
      blunt instrument, and that didn’t count. They believed that foreigners
      were always immoral; and though they had an occasional assize at home, and
      now and then a divorce case or so, that had nothing to do with it. They
      believed that foreigners had no independent spirit, as never being
      escorted to the poll in droves by Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle, with colours
      flying and the tune of Rule Britannia playing. Not to be tedious, they had
      many other beliefs of a similar kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against these obstacles, the lame foreigner with the stick had to make
      head as well as he could; not absolutely single-handed, because Mr Arthur
      Clennam had recommended him to the Plornishes (he lived at the top of the
      same house), but still at heavy odds. However, the Bleeding Hearts were
      kind hearts; and when they saw the little fellow cheerily limping about
      with a good-humoured face, doing no harm, drawing no knives, committing no
      outrageous immoralities, living chiefly on farinaceous and milk diet, and
      playing with Mrs Plornish’s children of an evening, they began to think
      that although he could never hope to be an Englishman, still it would be
      hard to visit that affliction on his head. They began to accommodate
      themselves to his level, calling him ‘Mr Baptist,’ but treating him like a
      baby, and laughing immoderately at his lively gestures and his childish
      English—more, because he didn’t mind it, and laughed too. They spoke
      to him in very loud voices as if he were stone deaf. They constructed
      sentences, by way of teaching him the language in its purity, such as were
      addressed by the savages to Captain Cook, or by Friday to Robinson Crusoe.
      Mrs Plornish was particularly ingenious in this art; and attained so much
      celebrity for saying ‘Me ope you leg well soon,’ that it was considered in
      the Yard but a very short remove indeed from speaking Italian. Even Mrs
      Plornish herself began to think that she had a natural call towards that
      language. As he became more popular, household objects were brought into
      requisition for his instruction in a copious vocabulary; and whenever he
      appeared in the Yard ladies would fly out at their doors crying ‘Mr
      Baptist—tea-pot!’ ‘Mr Baptist—dust-pan!’ ‘Mr Baptist—flour-dredger!’ 
      ‘Mr Baptist—coffee-biggin!’ At the same time exhibiting those
      articles, and penetrating him with a sense of the appalling difficulties
      of the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this stage of his progress, and in about the third week of his
      occupation, that Mr Pancks’s fancy became attracted by the little man.
      Mounting to his attic, attended by Mrs Plornish as interpreter, he found
      Mr Baptist with no furniture but his bed on the ground, a table, and a
      chair, carving with the aid of a few simple tools, in the blithest way
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, old chap,’ said Mr Pancks, ‘pay up!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had his money ready, folded in a scrap of paper, and laughingly handed
      it in; then with a free action, threw out as many fingers of his right
      hand as there were shillings, and made a cut crosswise in the air for an
      odd sixpence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ said Mr Pancks, watching him, wonderingly. ‘That’s it, is it? You’re
      a quick customer. It’s all right. I didn’t expect to receive it, though.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Plornish here interposed with great condescension, and explained to Mr
      Baptist. ‘E please. E glad get money.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man smiled and nodded. His bright face seemed uncommonly
      attractive to Mr Pancks. ‘How’s he getting on in his limb?’ he asked Mrs
      Plornish.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, he’s a deal better, sir,’ said Mrs Plornish. ‘We expect next week
      he’ll be able to leave off his stick entirely.’ (The opportunity being too
      favourable to be lost, Mrs Plornish displayed her great accomplishment by
      explaining with pardonable pride to Mr Baptist, ‘E ope you leg well
      soon.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He’s a merry fellow, too,’ said Mr Pancks, admiring him as if he were a
      mechanical toy. ‘How does he live?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, sir,’ rejoined Mrs Plornish, ‘he turns out to have quite a power of
      carving them flowers that you see him at now.’ (Mr Baptist, watching their
      faces as they spoke, held up his work. Mrs Plornish interpreted in her
      Italian manner, on behalf of Mr Pancks, ‘E please. Double good!’)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can he live by that?’ asked Mr Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He can live on very little, sir, and it is expected as he will be able,
      in time, to make a very good living. Mr Clennam got it him to do, and
      gives him odd jobs besides in at the Works next door—makes ‘em for
      him, in short, when he knows he wants ‘em.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And what does he do with himself, now, when he ain’t hard at it?’ said Mr
      Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, not much as yet, sir, on accounts I suppose of not being able to
      walk much; but he goes about the Yard, and he chats without particular
      understanding or being understood, and he plays with the children, and he
      sits in the sun—he’ll sit down anywhere, as if it was an arm-chair—and
      he’ll sing, and he’ll laugh!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Laugh!’ echoed Mr Pancks. ‘He looks to me as if every tooth in his head
      was always laughing.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But whenever he gets to the top of the steps at t’other end of the Yard,’ 
      said Mrs Plornish, ‘he’ll peep out in the curiousest way! So that some of
      us thinks he’s peeping out towards where his own country is, and some of
      us thinks he’s looking for somebody he don’t want to see, and some of us
      don’t know what to think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Baptist seemed to have a general understanding of what she said; or
      perhaps his quickness caught and applied her slight action of peeping. In
      any case he closed his eyes and tossed his head with the air of a man who
      had sufficient reasons for what he did, and said in his own tongue, it
      didn’t matter. Altro!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s Altro?’ said Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hem! It’s a sort of a general kind of expression, sir,’ said Mrs
      Plornish.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is it?’ said Pancks. ‘Why, then Altro to you, old chap. Good afternoon.
      Altro!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Baptist in his vivacious way repeating the word several times, Mr
      Pancks in his duller way gave it him back once. From that time it became a
      frequent custom with Pancks the gipsy, as he went home jaded at night, to
      pass round by Bleeding Heart Yard, go quietly up the stairs, look in at Mr
      Baptist’s door, and, finding him in his room, to say, ‘Hallo, old chap!
      Altro!’ To which Mr Baptist would reply with innumerable bright nods and
      smiles, ‘Altro, signore, altro, altro, altro!’ After this highly condensed
      conversation, Mr Pancks would go his way with an appearance of being
      lightened and refreshed.

	</hgroup>
<p>If Arthur Clennam had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain
      himself from loving Pet, he would have lived on in a state of much
      perplexity, involving difficult struggles with his own heart. Not the
      least of these would have been a contention, always waging within it,
      between a tendency to dislike Mr Henry Gowan, if not to regard him with
      positive repugnance, and a whisper that the inclination was unworthy. A
      generous nature is not prone to strong aversions, and is slow to admit
      them even dispassionately; but when it finds ill-will gaining upon it, and
      can discern between-whiles that its origin is not dispassionate, such a
      nature becomes distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Mr Henry Gowan would have clouded Clennam’s mind, and would have
      been far oftener present to it than more agreeable persons and subjects
      but for the great prudence of his decision aforesaid. As it was, Mr Gowan
      seemed transferred to Daniel Doyce’s mind; at all events, it so happened
      that it usually fell to Mr Doyce’s turn, rather than to Clennam’s, to
      speak of him in the friendly conversations they held together. These were
      of frequent occurrence now; as the two partners shared a portion of a
      roomy house in one of the grave old-fashioned City streets, lying not far
      from the Bank of England, by London Wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Doyce had been to Twickenham to pass the day. Clennam had excused
      himself. Mr Doyce was just come home. He put in his head at the door of
      Clennam’s sitting-room to say Good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Come in, come in!’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I saw you were reading,’ returned Doyce, as he entered, ‘and thought you
      might not care to be disturbed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the notable resolution he had made, Clennam really might not have
      known what he had been reading; really might not have had his eyes upon
      the book for an hour past, though it lay open before him. He shut it up,
      rather quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are they well?’ he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes,’ said Doyce; ‘they are well. They are all well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel had an old workmanlike habit of carrying his pocket-handkerchief in
      his hat. He took it out and wiped his forehead with it, slowly repeating,
      ‘They are all well. Miss Minnie looking particularly well, I thought.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Any company at the cottage?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no company.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And how did you get on, you four?’ asked Clennam gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There were five of us,’ returned his partner. ‘There was What’s-his-name.
      He was there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who is he?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Henry Gowan.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, to be sure!’ cried Clennam with unusual vivacity, ‘Yes!—I
      forgot him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As I mentioned, you may remember,’ said Daniel Doyce, ‘he is always there
      on Sunday.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes,’ returned Clennam; ‘I remember now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel Doyce, still wiping his forehead, ploddingly repeated. ‘Yes. He was
      there, he was there. Oh yes, he was there. And his dog. <i>He</i> was
      there too.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Meagles is quite attached to—the—dog,’ observed Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Quite so,’ assented his partner. ‘More attached to the dog than I am to
      the man.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You mean Mr—?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I mean Mr Gowan, most decidedly,’ said Daniel Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gap in the conversation, which Clennam devoted to winding up
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps you are a little hasty in your judgment,’ he said. ‘Our judgments—I
      am supposing a general case—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course,’ said Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are so liable to be influenced by many considerations, which, almost
      without our knowing it, are unfair, that it is necessary to keep a guard
      upon them. For instance, Mr—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Gowan,’ quietly said Doyce, upon whom the utterance of the name almost
      always devolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is young and handsome, easy and quick, has talent, and has seen a good
      deal of various kinds of life. It might be difficult to give an unselfish
      reason for being prepossessed against him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not difficult for me, I think, Clennam,’ returned his partner. ‘I see him
      bringing present anxiety, and, I fear, future sorrow, into my old friend’s
      house. I see him wearing deeper lines into my old friend’s face, the
      nearer he draws to, and the oftener he looks at, the face of his daughter.
      In short, I see him with a net about the pretty and affectionate creature
      whom he will never make happy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We don’t know,’ said Clennam, almost in the tone of a man in pain, ‘that
      he will not make her happy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We don’t know,’ returned his partner, ‘that the earth will last another
      hundred years, but we think it highly probable.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, well!’ said Clennam, ‘we must be hopeful, and we must at least try
      to be, if not generous (which, in this case, we have no opportunity of
      being), just. We will not disparage this gentleman, because he is
      successful in his addresses to the beautiful object of his ambition; and
      we will not question her natural right to bestow her love on one whom she
      finds worthy of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Maybe, my friend,’ said Doyce. ‘Maybe also, that she is too young and
      petted, too confiding and inexperienced, to discriminate well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That,’ said Clennam, ‘would be far beyond our power of correction.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel Doyce shook his head gravely, and rejoined, ‘I fear so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Therefore, in a word,’ said Clennam, ‘we should make up our minds that it
      is not worthy of us to say any ill of Mr Gowan. It would be a poor thing
      to gratify a prejudice against him. And I resolve, for my part, not to
      depreciate him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am not quite so sure of myself, and therefore I reserve my privilege of
      objecting to him,’ returned the other. ‘But, if I am not sure of myself, I
      am sure of you, Clennam, and I know what an upright man you are, and how
      much to be respected. Good night, <i>my</i> friend and partner!’ He shook
      his hand in saying this, as if there had been something serious at the
      bottom of their conversation; and they separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had visited the family on several occasions, and had
      always observed that even a passing allusion to Mr Henry Gowan when he was
      not among them, brought back the cloud which had obscured Mr Meagles’s
      sunshine on the morning of the chance encounter at the Ferry. If Clennam
      had ever admitted the forbidden passion into his breast, this period might
      have been a period of real trial; under the actual circumstances,
      doubtless it was nothing—nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Equally, if his heart had given entertainment to that prohibited guest,
      his silent fighting of his way through the mental condition of this period
      might have been a little meritorious. In the constant effort not to be
      betrayed into a new phase of the besetting sin of his experience, the
      pursuit of selfish objects by low and small means, and to hold instead to
      some high principle of honour and generosity, there might have been a
      little merit. In the resolution not even to avoid Mr Meagles’s house,
      lest, in the selfish sparing of himself, he should bring any slight
      distress upon the daughter through making her the cause of an estrangement
      which he believed the father would regret, there might have been a little
      merit. In the modest truthfulness of always keeping in view the greater
      equality of Mr Gowan’s years and the greater attractions of his person and
      manner, there might have been a little merit. In doing all this and much
      more, in a perfectly unaffected way and with a manful and composed
      constancy, while the pain within him (peculiar as his life and history)
      was very sharp, there might have been some quiet strength of character.
      But, after the resolution he had made, of course he could have no such
      merits as these; and such a state of mind was nobody’s—nobody’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Gowan made it no concern of his whether it was nobody’s or somebody’s.
      He preserved his perfect serenity of manner on all occasions, as if the
      possibility of Clennam’s presuming to have debated the great question were
      too distant and ridiculous to be imagined. He had always an affability to
      bestow on Clennam and an ease to treat him with, which might of itself (in
      the supposititious case of his not having taken that sagacious course)
      have been a very uncomfortable element in his state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I quite regret you were not with us yesterday,’ said Mr Henry Gowan,
      calling on Clennam the next morning. ‘We had an agreeable day up the river
      there.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had heard, Arthur said.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘From your partner?’ returned Henry Gowan. ‘What a dear old fellow he is!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have a great regard for him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By Jove, he is the finest creature!’ said Gowan. ‘So fresh, so green,
      trusts in such wonderful things!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was one of the many little rough points that had a tendency to grate
      on Clennam’s hearing. He put it aside by merely repeating that he had a
      high regard for Mr Doyce.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He is charming! To see him mooning along to that time of life, laying
      down nothing by the way and picking up nothing by the way, is delightful.
      It warms a man. So unspoilt, so simple, such a good soul! Upon my life Mr
      Clennam, one feels desperately worldly and wicked in comparison with such
      an innocent creature. I speak for myself, let me add, without including
      you. You are genuine also.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you for the compliment,’ said Clennam, ill at ease; ‘you are too, I
      hope?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So so,’ rejoined the other. ‘To be candid with you, tolerably. I am not a
      great impostor. Buy one of my pictures, and I assure you, in confidence,
      it will not be worth the money. Buy one of another man’s—any great
      professor who beats me hollow—and the chances are that the more you
      give him, the more he’ll impose upon you. They all do it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All painters?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Painters, writers, patriots, all the rest who have stands in the market.
      Give almost any man I know ten pounds, and he will impose upon you to a
      corresponding extent; a thousand pounds—to a corresponding extent;
      ten thousand pounds—to a corresponding extent. So great the success,
      so great the imposition. But what a capital world it is!’ cried Gowan with
      warm enthusiasm. ‘What a jolly, excellent, lovable world it is!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I had rather thought,’ said Clennam, ‘that the principle you mention was
      chiefly acted on by—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By the Barnacles?’ interrupted Gowan, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By the political gentlemen who condescend to keep the Circumlocution
      Office.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! Don’t be hard upon the Barnacles,’ said Gowan, laughing afresh, ‘they
      are darling fellows! Even poor little Clarence, the born idiot of the
      family, is the most agreeable and most endearing blockhead! And by
      Jupiter, with a kind of cleverness in him too that would astonish you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It would. Very much,’ said Clennam, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And after all,’ cried Gowan, with that characteristic balancing of his
      which reduced everything in the wide world to the same light weight,
      ‘though I can’t deny that the Circumlocution Office may ultimately
      shipwreck everybody and everything, still, that will probably not be in
      our time—and it’s a school for gentlemen.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s a very dangerous, unsatisfactory, and expensive school to the people
      who pay to keep the pupils there, I am afraid,’ said Clennam, shaking his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah! You are a terrible fellow,’ returned Gowan, airily. ‘I can understand
      how you have frightened that little donkey, Clarence, the most estimable
      of moon-calves (I really love him) nearly out of his wits. But enough of
      him, and of all the rest of them. I want to present you to my mother, Mr
      Clennam. Pray do me the favour to give me the opportunity.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In nobody’s state of mind, there was nothing Clennam would have desired
      less, or would have been more at a loss how to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My mother lives in a most primitive manner down in that dreary red-brick
      dungeon at Hampton Court,’ said Gowan. ‘If you would make your own
      appointment, suggest your own day for permitting me to take you there to
      dinner, you would be bored and she would be charmed. Really that’s the
      state of the case.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Clennam say after this? His retiring character included a great
      deal that was simple in the best sense, because unpractised and unused;
      and in his simplicity and modesty, he could only say that he was happy to
      place himself at Mr Gowan’s disposal. Accordingly he said it, and the day
      was fixed. And a dreaded day it was on his part, and a very unwelcome day
      when it came and they went down to Hampton Court together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The venerable inhabitants of that venerable pile seemed, in those times,
      to be encamped there like a sort of civilised gipsies. There was a
      temporary air about their establishments, as if they were going away the
      moment they could get anything better; there was also a dissatisfied air
      about themselves, as if they took it very ill that they had not already
      got something much better. Genteel blinds and makeshifts were more or less
      observable as soon as their doors were opened; screens not half high
      enough, which made dining-rooms out of arched passages, and warded off
      obscure corners where footboys slept at nights with their heads among the
      knives and forks; curtains which called upon you to believe that they
      didn’t hide anything; panes of glass which requested you not to see them;
      many objects of various forms, feigning to have no connection with their
      guilty secret, a bed; disguised traps in walls, which were clearly
      coal-cellars; affectations of no thoroughfares, which were evidently doors
      to little kitchens. Mental reservations and artful mysteries grew out of
      these things. Callers looking steadily into the eyes of their receivers,
      pretended not to smell cooking three feet off; people, confronting closets
      accidentally left open, pretended not to see bottles; visitors with their
      heads against a partition of thin canvas, and a page and a young female at
      high words on the other side, made believe to be sitting in a primeval
      silence. There was no end to the small social accommodation-bills of this
      nature which the gipsies of gentility were constantly drawing upon, and
      accepting for, one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of these Bohemians were of an irritable temperament, as constantly
      soured and vexed by two mental trials: the first, the consciousness that
      they had never got enough out of the public; the second, the consciousness
      that the public were admitted into the building. Under the latter great
      wrong, a few suffered dreadfully—particularly on Sundays, when they
      had for some time expected the earth to open and swallow the public up;
      but which desirable event had not yet occurred, in consequence of some
      reprehensible laxity in the arrangements of the Universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan’s door was attended by a family servant of several years’ 
      standing, who had his own crow to pluck with the public concerning a
      situation in the Post-Office which he had been for some time expecting,
      and to which he was not yet appointed. He perfectly knew that the public
      could never have got him in, but he grimly gratified himself with the idea
      that the public kept him out. Under the influence of this injury (and
      perhaps of some little straitness and irregularity in the matter of
      wages), he had grown neglectful of his person and morose in mind; and now
      beholding in Clennam one of the degraded body of his oppressors, received
      him with ignominy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan, however, received him with condescension. He found her a
      courtly old lady, formerly a Beauty, and still sufficiently well-favoured
      to have dispensed with the powder on her nose and a certain impossible
      bloom under each eye. She was a little lofty with him; so was another old
      lady, dark-browed and high-nosed, and who must have had something real
      about her or she could not have existed, but it was certainly not her hair
      or her teeth or her figure or her complexion; so was a grey old gentleman
      of dignified and sullen appearance; both of whom had come to dinner. But,
      as they had all been in the British Embassy way in sundry parts of the
      earth, and as a British Embassy cannot better establish a character with
      the Circumlocution Office than by treating its compatriots with
      illimitable contempt (else it would become like the Embassies of other
      countries), Clennam felt that on the whole they let him off lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dignified old gentleman turned out to be Lord Lancaster Stiltstalking,
      who had been maintained by the Circumlocution Office for many years as a
      representative of the Britannic Majesty abroad. This noble Refrigerator
      had iced several European courts in his time, and had done it with such
      complete success that the very name of Englishman yet struck cold to the
      stomachs of foreigners who had the distinguished honour of remembering him
      at a distance of a quarter of a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now in retirement, and hence (in a ponderous white cravat, like a
      stiff snow-drift) was so obliging as to shade the dinner. There was a
      whisper of the pervading Bohemian character in the nomadic nature of the
      service and its curious races of plates and dishes; but the noble
      Refrigerator, infinitely better than plate or porcelain, made it superb.
      He shaded the dinner, cooled the wines, chilled the gravy, and blighted
      the vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one other person in the room: a microscopically small
      footboy, who waited on the malevolent man who hadn’t got into the
      Post-Office. Even this youth, if his jacket could have been unbuttoned and
      his heart laid bare, would have been seen, as a distant adherent of the
      Barnacle family, already to aspire to a situation under Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan with a gentle melancholy upon her, occasioned by her son’s being
      reduced to court the swinish public as a follower of the low Arts, instead
      of asserting his birthright and putting a ring through its nose as an
      acknowledged Barnacle, headed the conversation at dinner on the evil days.
      It was then that Clennam learned for the first time what little pivots
      this great world goes round upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If John Barnacle,’ said Mrs Gowan, after the degeneracy of the times had
      been fully ascertained, ‘if John Barnacle had but abandoned his most
      unfortunate idea of conciliating the mob, all would have been well, and I
      think the country would have been preserved.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady with the high nose assented; but added that if Augustus
      Stiltstalking had in a general way ordered the cavalry out with
      instructions to charge, she thought the country would have been preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noble Refrigerator assented; but added that if William Barnacle and
      Tudor Stiltstalking, when they came over to one another and formed their
      ever-memorable coalition, had boldly muzzled the newspapers, and rendered
      it penal for any Editor-person to presume to discuss the conduct of any
      appointed authority abroad or at home, he thought the country would have
      been preserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that the country (another word for the Barnacles and
      Stiltstalkings) wanted preserving, but how it came to want preserving was
      not so clear. It was only clear that the question was all about John
      Barnacle, Augustus Stiltstalking, William Barnacle and Tudor
      Stiltstalking, Tom, Dick, or Harry Barnacle or Stiltstalking, because
      there was nobody else but mob. And this was the feature of the
      conversation which impressed Clennam, as a man not used to it, very
      disagreeably: making him doubt if it were quite right to sit there,
      silently hearing a great nation narrowed to such little bounds.
      Remembering, however, that in the Parliamentary debates, whether on the
      life of that nation’s body or the life of its soul, the question was
      usually all about and between John Barnacle, Augustus Stiltstalking,
      William Barnacle and Tudor Stiltstalking, Tom, Dick, or Harry Barnacle or
      Stiltstalking, and nobody else; he said nothing on the part of mob,
      bethinking himself that mob was used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henry Gowan seemed to have a malicious pleasure in playing off the
      three talkers against each other, and in seeing Clennam startled by what
      they said. Having as supreme a contempt for the class that had thrown him
      off as for the class that had not taken him on, he had no personal
      disquiet in anything that passed. His healthy state of mind appeared even
      to derive a gratification from Clennam’s position of embarrassment and
      isolation among the good company; and if Clennam had been in that
      condition with which Nobody was incessantly contending, he would have
      suspected it, and would have struggled with the suspicion as a meanness,
      even while he sat at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a couple of hours the noble Refrigerator, at no time less
      than a hundred years behind the period, got about five centuries in
      arrears, and delivered solemn political oracles appropriate to that epoch.
      He finished by freezing a cup of tea for his own drinking, and retiring at
      his lowest temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs Gowan, who had been accustomed in her days of a vacant arm-chair
      beside her to which to summon state to retain her devoted slaves, one by
      one, for short audiences as marks of her especial favour, invited Clennam
      with a turn of her fan to approach the presence. He obeyed, and took the
      tripod recently vacated by Lord Lancaster Stiltstalking.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam,’ said Mrs Gowan, ‘apart from the happiness I have in becoming
      known to you, though in this odiously inconvenient place—a mere
      barrack—there is a subject on which I am dying to speak to you. It
      is the subject in connection with which my son first had, I believe, the
      pleasure of cultivating your acquaintance.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam inclined his head, as a generally suitable reply to what he did
      not yet quite understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘First,’ said Mrs Gowan, ‘now, is she really pretty?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In nobody’s difficulties, he would have found it very difficult to answer;
      very difficult indeed to smile, and say ‘Who?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! You know!’ she returned. ‘This flame of Henry’s. This unfortunate
      fancy. There! If it is a point of honour that I should originate the name—Miss
      Mickles—Miggles.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Meagles,’ said Clennam, ‘is very beautiful.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Men are so often mistaken on those points,’ returned Mrs Gowan, shaking
      her head, ‘that I candidly confess to you I feel anything but sure of it,
      even now; though it is something to have Henry corroborated with so much
      gravity and emphasis. He picked the people up at Rome, I think?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase would have given nobody mortal offence. Clennam replied,
      ‘Excuse me, I doubt if I understand your expression.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Picked the people up,’ said Mrs Gowan, tapping the sticks of her closed
      fan (a large green one, which she used as a hand-screen) on her little
      table. ‘Came upon them. Found them out. Stumbled against them.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The people?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes. The Miggles people.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I really cannot say,’ said Clennam, ‘where my friend Mr Meagles first
      presented Mr Henry Gowan to his daughter.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am pretty sure he picked her up at Rome; but never mind where—somewhere.
      Now (this is entirely between ourselves), is she very plebeian?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really, ma’am,’ returned Clennam, ‘I am so undoubtedly plebeian myself,
      that I do not feel qualified to judge.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very neat!’ said Mrs Gowan, coolly unfurling her screen. ‘Very happy!
      From which I infer that you secretly think her manner equal to her looks?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam, after a moment’s stiffness, bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s comforting, and I hope you may be right. Did Henry tell me you had
      travelled with them?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I travelled with my friend Mr Meagles, and his wife and daughter, during
      some months.’ (Nobody’s heart might have been wrung by the remembrance.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Really comforting, because you must have had a large experience of them.
      You see, Mr Clennam, this thing has been going on for a long time, and I
      find no improvement in it. Therefore to have the opportunity of speaking
      to one so well informed about it as yourself, is an immense relief to me.
      Quite a boon. Quite a blessing, I am sure.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pardon me,’ returned Clennam, ‘but I am not in Mr Henry Gowan’s
      confidence. I am far from being so well informed as you suppose me to be.
      Your mistake makes my position a very delicate one. No word on this topic
      has ever passed between Mr Henry Gowan and myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan glanced at the other end of the room, where her son was playing
      ecarte on a sofa, with the old lady who was for a charge of cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not in his confidence? No,’ said Mrs Gowan. ‘No word has passed between
      you? No. That I can imagine. But there are unexpressed confidences, Mr
      Clennam; and as you have been together intimately among these people, I
      cannot doubt that a confidence of that sort exists in the present case.
      Perhaps you have heard that I have suffered the keenest distress of mind
      from Henry’s having taken to a pursuit which—well!’ shrugging her
      shoulders, ‘a very respectable pursuit, I dare say, and some artists are,
      as artists, quite superior persons; still, we never yet in our family have
      gone beyond an Amateur, and it is a pardonable weakness to feel a little—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mrs Gowan broke off to heave a sigh, Clennam, however resolute to be
      magnanimous, could not keep down the thought that there was mighty little
      danger of the family’s ever going beyond an Amateur, even as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Henry,’ the mother resumed, ‘is self-willed and resolute; and as these
      people naturally strain every nerve to catch him, I can entertain very
      little hope, Mr Clennam, that the thing will be broken off. I apprehend
      the girl’s fortune will be very small; Henry might have done much better;
      there is scarcely anything to compensate for the connection: still, he
      acts for himself; and if I find no improvement within a short time, I see
      no other course than to resign myself and make the best of these people. I
      am infinitely obliged to you for what you have told me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she shrugged her shoulders, Clennam stiffly bowed again. With an uneasy
      flush upon his face, and hesitation in his manner, he then said in a still
      lower tone than he had adopted yet:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Gowan, I scarcely know how to acquit myself of what I feel to be a
      duty, and yet I must ask you for your kind consideration in attempting to
      discharge it. A misconception on your part, a very great misconception if
      I may venture to call it so, seems to require setting right. You have
      supposed Mr Meagles and his family to strain every nerve, I think you said—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Every nerve,’ repeated Mrs Gowan, looking at him in calm obstinacy, with
      her green fan between her face and the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To secure Mr Henry Gowan?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady placidly assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now that is so far,’ said Arthur, ‘from being the case, that I know Mr
      Meagles to be unhappy in this matter; and to have interposed all
      reasonable obstacles with the hope of putting an end to it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan shut up her great green fan, tapped him on the arm with it, and
      tapped her smiling lips. ‘Why, of course,’ said she. ‘Just what I mean.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur watched her face for some explanation of what she did mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you really serious, Mr Clennam? Don’t you see?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur did not see; and said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, don’t I know my son, and don’t I know that this is exactly the way
      to hold him?’ said Mrs Gowan, contemptuously; ‘and do not these Miggles
      people know it, at least as well as I? Oh, shrewd people, Mr Clennam:
      evidently people of business! I believe Miggles belonged to a Bank. It
      ought to have been a very profitable Bank, if he had much to do with its
      management. This is very well done, indeed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg and entreat you, ma’am—’ Arthur interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Mr Clennam, can you really be so credulous?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It made such a painful impression upon him to hear her talking in this
      haughty tone, and to see her patting her contemptuous lips with her fan,
      that he said very earnestly, ‘Believe me, ma’am, this is unjust, a
      perfectly groundless suspicion.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Suspicion?’ repeated Mrs Gowan. ‘Not suspicion, Mr Clennam, Certainty. It
      is very knowingly done indeed, and seems to have taken <i>you</i> in
      completely.’ She laughed; and again sat tapping her lips with her fan, and
      tossing her head, as if she added, ‘Don’t tell me. I know such people will
      do anything for the honour of such an alliance.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this opportune moment, the cards were thrown up, and Mr Henry Gowan
      came across the room saying, ‘Mother, if you can spare Mr Clennam for this
      time, we have a long way to go, and it’s getting late.’ Mr Clennam
      thereupon rose, as he had no choice but to do; and Mrs Gowan showed him,
      to the last, the same look and the same tapped contemptuous lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have had a portentously long audience of my mother,’ said Gowan, as
      the door closed upon them. ‘I fervently hope she has not bored you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all,’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a little open phaeton for the journey, and were soon in it on the
      road home. Gowan, driving, lighted a cigar; Clennam declined one. Do what
      he would, he fell into such a mood of abstraction that Gowan said again,
      ‘I am very much afraid my mother has bored you?’ To which he roused
      himself to answer, ‘Not at all!’ and soon relapsed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that state of mind which rendered nobody uneasy, his thoughtfulness
      would have turned principally on the man at his side. He would have
      thought of the morning when he first saw him rooting out the stones with
      his heel, and would have asked himself, ‘Does he jerk me out of the path
      in the same careless, cruel way?’ He would have thought, had this
      introduction to his mother been brought about by him because he knew what
      she would say, and that he could thus place his position before a rival
      and loftily warn him off, without himself reposing a word of confidence in
      him? He would have thought, even if there were no such design as that, had
      he brought him there to play with his repressed emotions, and torment him?
      The current of these meditations would have been stayed sometimes by a
      rush of shame, bearing a remonstrance to himself from his own open nature,
      representing that to shelter such suspicions, even for the passing moment,
      was not to hold the high, unenvious course he had resolved to keep. At
      those times, the striving within him would have been hardest; and looking
      up and catching Gowan’s eyes, he would have started as if he had done him
      an injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, looking at the dark road and its uncertain objects, he would have
      gradually trailed off again into thinking, ‘Where are we driving, he and
      I, I wonder, on the darker road of life? How will it be with us, and with
      her, in the obscure distance?’ Thinking of her, he would have been
      troubled anew with a reproachful misgiving that it was not even loyal to
      her to dislike him, and that in being so easily prejudiced against him he
      was less deserving of her than at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are evidently out of spirits,’ said Gowan; ‘I am very much afraid my
      mother must have bored you dreadfully.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Believe me, not at all,’ said Clennam. ‘It’s nothing—nothing!’

	</hgroup>
<p>A frequently recurring doubt, whether Mr Pancks’s desire to collect
      information relative to the Dorrit family could have any possible bearing
      on the misgivings he had imparted to his mother on his return from his
      long exile, caused Arthur Clennam much uneasiness at this period. What Mr
      Pancks already knew about the Dorrit family, what more he really wanted to
      find out, and why he should trouble his busy head about them at all, were
      questions that often perplexed him. Mr Pancks was not a man to waste his
      time and trouble in researches prompted by idle curiosity. That he had a
      specific object Clennam could not doubt. And whether the attainment of
      that object by Mr Pancks’s industry might bring to light, in some untimely
      way, secret reasons which had induced his mother to take Little Dorrit by
      the hand, was a serious speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that he ever wavered either in his desire or his determination to
      repair a wrong that had been done in his father’s time, should a wrong
      come to light, and be reparable. The shadow of a supposed act of
      injustice, which had hung over him since his father’s death, was so vague
      and formless that it might be the result of a reality widely remote from
      his idea of it. But, if his apprehensions should prove to be well founded,
      he was ready at any moment to lay down all he had, and begin the world
      anew. As the fierce dark teaching of his childhood had never sunk into his
      heart, so that first article in his code of morals was, that he must
      begin, in practical humility, with looking well to his feet on Earth, and
      that he could never mount on wings of words to Heaven. Duty on earth,
      restitution on earth, action on earth; these first, as the first steep
      steps upward. Strait was the gate and narrow was the way; far straiter and
      narrower than the broad high road paved with vain professions and vain
      repetitions, motes from other men’s eyes and liberal delivery of others to
      the judgment—all cheap materials costing absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. It was not a selfish fear or hesitation that rendered him uneasy, but
      a mistrust lest Pancks might not observe his part of the understanding
      between them, and, making any discovery, might take some course upon it
      without imparting it to him. On the other hand, when he recalled his
      conversation with Pancks, and the little reason he had to suppose that
      there was any likelihood of that strange personage being on that track at
      all, there were times when he wondered that he made so much of it.
      Labouring in this sea, as all barks labour in cross seas, he tossed about
      and came to no haven.
    </p>
    <p>
      The removal of Little Dorrit herself from their customary association, did
      not mend the matter. She was so much out, and so much in her own room,
      that he began to miss her and to find a blank in her place. He had written
      to her to inquire if she were better, and she had written back, very
      gratefully and earnestly telling him not to be uneasy on her behalf, for
      she was quite well; but he had not seen her, for what, in their
      intercourse, was a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned home one evening from an interview with her father, who had
      mentioned that she was out visiting—which was what he always said
      when she was hard at work to buy his supper—and found Mr Meagles in
      an excited state walking up and down his room. On his opening the door, Mr
      Meagles stopped, faced round, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Clennam!—Tattycoram!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lost!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, bless my heart alive!’ cried Clennam in amazement. ‘What do you
      mean?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Wouldn’t count five-and-twenty, sir; couldn’t be got to do it; stopped at
      eight, and took herself off.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Left your house?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Never to come back,’ said Mr Meagles, shaking his head. ‘You don’t know
      that girl’s passionate and proud character. A team of horses couldn’t draw
      her back now; the bolts and bars of the old Bastille couldn’t keep her.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How did it happen? Pray sit down and tell me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to how it happened, it’s not so easy to relate: because you must have
      the unfortunate temperament of the poor impetuous girl herself, before you
      can fully understand it. But it came about in this way. Pet and Mother and
      I have been having a good deal of talk together of late. I’ll not disguise
      from you, Clennam, that those conversations have not been of as bright a
      kind as I could wish; they have referred to our going away again. In
      proposing to do which, I have had, in fact, an object.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody’s heart beat quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘An object,’ said Mr Meagles, after a moment’s pause, ‘that I will not
      disguise from you, either, Clennam. There’s an inclination on the part of
      my dear child which I am sorry for. Perhaps you guess the person. Henry
      Gowan.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was not unprepared to hear it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ said Mr Meagles, with a heavy sigh, ‘I wish to God you had never
      had to hear it. However, so it is. Mother and I have done all we could to
      get the better of it, Clennam. We have tried tender advice, we have tried
      time, we have tried absence. As yet, of no use. Our late conversations
      have been upon the subject of going away for another year at least, in
      order that there might be an entire separation and breaking off for that
      term. Upon that question, Pet has been unhappy, and therefore Mother and I
      have been unhappy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam said that he could easily believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ continued Mr Meagles in an apologetic way, ‘I admit as a practical
      man, and I am sure Mother would admit as a practical woman, that we do, in
      families, magnify our troubles and make mountains of our molehills in a
      way that is calculated to be rather trying to people who look on—to
      mere outsiders, you know, Clennam. Still, Pet’s happiness or unhappiness
      is quite a life or death question with us; and we may be excused, I hope,
      for making much of it. At all events, it might have been borne by
      Tattycoram. Now, don’t you think so?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do indeed think so,’ returned Clennam, in most emphatic recognition of
      this very moderate expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir,’ said Mr Meagles, shaking his head ruefully. ‘She couldn’t stand
      it. The chafing and firing of that girl, the wearing and tearing of that
      girl within her own breast, has been such that I have softly said to her
      again and again in passing her, “Five-and-twenty, Tattycoram,
      five-and-twenty!” I heartily wish she could have gone on counting
      five-and-twenty day and night, and then it wouldn’t have happened.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles with a despondent countenance in which the goodness of his
      heart was even more expressed than in his times of cheerfulness and
      gaiety, stroked his face down from his forehead to his chin, and shook his
      head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I said to Mother (not that it was necessary, for she would have thought
      it all for herself), we are practical people, my dear, and we know her
      story; we see in this unhappy girl some reflection of what was raging in
      her mother’s heart before ever such a creature as this poor thing was in
      the world; we’ll gloss her temper over, Mother, we won’t notice it at
      present, my dear, we’ll take advantage of some better disposition in her
      another time. So we said nothing. But, do what we would, it seems as if it
      was to be; she broke out violently one night.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How, and why?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you ask me Why,’ said Mr Meagles, a little disturbed by the question,
      for he was far more intent on softening her case than the family’s, ‘I can
      only refer you to what I have just repeated as having been pretty near my
      words to Mother. As to How, we had said Good night to Pet in her presence
      (very affectionately, I must allow), and she had attended Pet up-stairs—you
      remember she was her maid. Perhaps Pet, having been out of sorts, may have
      been a little more inconsiderate than usual in requiring services of her:
      but I don’t know that I have any right to say so; she was always
      thoughtful and gentle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The gentlest mistress in the world.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, Clennam,’ said Mr Meagles, shaking him by the hand; ‘you have
      often seen them together. Well! We presently heard this unfortunate
      Tattycoram loud and angry, and before we could ask what was the matter,
      Pet came back in a tremble, saying she was frightened of her. Close after
      her came Tattycoram in a flaming rage. “I hate you all three,” says she,
      stamping her foot at us. “I am bursting with hate of the whole house.”’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Upon which you—?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I?’ said Mr Meagles, with a plain good faith that might have commanded
      the belief of Mrs Gowan herself. ‘I said, count five-and-twenty,
      Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles again stroked his face and shook his head, with an air of
      profound regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She was so used to do it, Clennam, that even then, such a picture of
      passion as you never saw, she stopped short, looked me full in the face,
      and counted (as I made out) to eight. But she couldn’t control herself to
      go any further. There she broke down, poor thing, and gave the other
      seventeen to the four winds. Then it all burst out. She detested us, she
      was miserable with us, she couldn’t bear it, she wouldn’t bear it, she was
      determined to go away. She was younger than her young mistress, and would
      she remain to see her always held up as the only creature who was young
      and interesting, and to be cherished and loved? No. She wouldn’t, she
      wouldn’t, she wouldn’t! What did we think she, Tattycoram, might have been
      if she had been caressed and cared for in her childhood, like her young
      mistress? As good as her? Ah! Perhaps fifty times as good. When we
      pretended to be so fond of one another, we exulted over her; that was what
      we did; we exulted over her and shamed her. And all in the house did the
      same. They talked about their fathers and mothers, and brothers and
      sisters; they liked to drag them up before her face. There was Mrs Tickit,
      only yesterday, when her little grandchild was with her, had been amused
      by the child’s trying to call her (Tattycoram) by the wretched name we
      gave her; and had laughed at the name. Why, who didn’t; and who were we
      that we should have a right to name her like a dog or a cat? But she
      didn’t care. She would take no more benefits from us; she would fling us
      her name back again, and she would go. She would leave us that minute,
      nobody should stop her, and we should never hear of her again.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles had recited all this with such a vivid remembrance of his
      original, that he was almost as flushed and hot by this time as he
      described her to have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, well!’ he said, wiping his face. ‘It was of no use trying reason
      then, with that vehement panting creature (Heaven knows what her mother’s
      story must have been); so I quietly told her that she should not go at
      that late hour of night, and I gave her my hand and took her to her room,
      and locked the house doors. But she was gone this morning.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you know no more of her?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No more,’ returned Mr Meagles. ‘I have been hunting about all day. She
      must have gone very early and very silently. I have found no trace of her
      down about us.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay! You want,’ said Clennam, after a moment’s reflection, ‘to see her?
      I assume that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, assuredly; I want to give her another chance; Mother and Pet want to
      give her another chance; come! You yourself,’ said Mr Meagles,
      persuasively, as if the provocation to be angry were not his own at all,
      ‘want to give the poor passionate girl another chance, I know, Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It would be strange and hard indeed if I did not,’ said Clennam, ‘when
      you are all so forgiving. What I was going to ask you was, have you
      thought of that Miss Wade?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have. I did not think of her until I had pervaded the whole of our
      neighbourhood, and I don’t know that I should have done so then but for
      finding Mother and Pet, when I went home, full of the idea that Tattycoram
      must have gone to her. Then, of course, I recalled what she said that day
      at dinner when you were first with us.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you any idea where Miss Wade is to be found?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To tell you the truth,’ returned Mr Meagles, ‘it’s because I have an
      addled jumble of a notion on that subject that you found me waiting here.
      There is one of those odd impressions in my house, which do mysteriously
      get into houses sometimes, which nobody seems to have picked up in a
      distinct form from anybody, and yet which everybody seems to have got hold
      of loosely from somebody and let go again, that she lives, or was living,
      thereabouts.’ Mr Meagles handed him a slip of paper, on which was written
      the name of one of the dull by-streets in the Grosvenor region, near Park
      Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Here is no number,’ said Arthur looking over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No number, my dear Clennam?’ returned his friend. ‘No anything! The very
      name of the street may have been floating in the air; for, as I tell you,
      none of my people can say where they got it from. However, it’s worth an
      inquiry; and as I would rather make it in company than alone, and as you
      too were a fellow-traveller of that immovable woman’s, I thought perhaps—’ 
      Clennam finished the sentence for him by taking up his hat again, and
      saying he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now summer-time; a grey, hot, dusty evening. They rode to the top
      of Oxford Street, and there alighting, dived in among the great streets of
      melancholy stateliness, and the little streets that try to be as stately
      and succeed in being more melancholy, of which there is a labyrinth near
      Park Lane. Wildernesses of corner houses, with barbarous old porticoes and
      appurtenances; horrors that came into existence under some wrong-headed
      person in some wrong-headed time, still demanding the blind admiration of
      all ensuing generations and determined to do so until they tumbled down;
      frowned upon the twilight. Parasite little tenements, with the cramp in
      their whole frame, from the dwarf hall-door on the giant model of His
      Grace’s in the Square to the squeezed window of the boudoir commanding the
      dunghills in the Mews, made the evening doleful. Rickety dwellings of
      undoubted fashion, but of a capacity to hold nothing comfortably except a
      dismal smell, looked like the last result of the great mansions’ breeding
      in-and-in; and, where their little supplementary bows and balconies were
      supported on thin iron columns, seemed to be scrofulously resting upon
      crutches. Here and there a Hatchment, with the whole science of Heraldry
      in it, loomed down upon the street, like an Archbishop discoursing on
      Vanity. The shops, few in number, made no show; for popular opinion was as
      nothing to them. The pastrycook knew who was on his books, and in that
      knowledge could be calm, with a few glass cylinders of dowager
      peppermint-drops in his window, and half-a-dozen ancient specimens of
      currant-jelly. A few oranges formed the greengrocer’s whole concession to
      the vulgar mind. A single basket made of moss, once containing plovers’ 
      eggs, held all that the poulterer had to say to the rabble. Everybody in
      those streets seemed (which is always the case at that hour and season) to
      be gone out to dinner, and nobody seemed to be giving the dinners they had
      gone to. On the doorsteps there were lounging footmen with bright
      parti-coloured plumage and white polls, like an extinct race of monstrous
      birds; and butlers, solitary men of recluse demeanour, each of whom
      appeared distrustful of all other butlers. The roll of carriages in the
      Park was done for the day; the street lamps were lighting; and wicked
      little grooms in the tightest fitting garments, with twists in their legs
      answering to the twists in their minds, hung about in pairs, chewing
      straws and exchanging fraudulent secrets. The spotted dogs who went out
      with the carriages, and who were so associated with splendid equipages
      that it looked like a condescension in those animals to come out without
      them, accompanied helpers to and fro on messages. Here and there was a
      retiring public-house which did not require to be supported on the
      shoulders of the people, and where gentlemen out of livery were not much
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last discovery was made by the two friends in pursuing their
      inquiries. Nothing was there, or anywhere, known of such a person as Miss
      Wade, in connection with the street they sought. It was one of the
      parasite streets; long, regular, narrow, dull and gloomy; like a brick and
      mortar funeral. They inquired at several little area gates, where a
      dejected youth stood spiking his chin on the summit of a precipitous
      little shoot of wooden steps, but could gain no information. They walked
      up the street on one side of the way, and down it on the other, what time
      two vociferous news-sellers, announcing an extraordinary event that had
      never happened and never would happen, pitched their hoarse voices into
      the secret chambers; but nothing came of it. At length they stood at the
      corner from which they had begun, and it had fallen quite dark, and they
      were no wiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that in the street they had several times passed a dingy
      house, apparently empty, with bills in the windows, announcing that it was
      to let. The bills, as a variety in the funeral procession, almost amounted
      to a decoration. Perhaps because they kept the house separated in his
      mind, or perhaps because Mr Meagles and himself had twice agreed in
      passing, ‘It is clear she don’t live there,’ Clennam now proposed that
      they should go back and try that house before finally going away. Mr
      Meagles agreed, and back they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knocked once, and they rang once, without any response. ‘Empty,’ said
      Mr Meagles, listening. ‘Once more,’ said Clennam, and knocked again. After
      that knock they heard a movement below, and somebody shuffling up towards
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confined entrance was so dark that it was impossible to make out
      distinctly what kind of person opened the door; but it appeared to be an
      old woman. ‘Excuse our troubling you,’ said Clennam. ‘Pray can you tell us
      where Miss Wade lives?’ The voice in the darkness unexpectedly replied,
      ‘Lives here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is she at home?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer coming, Mr Meagles asked again. ‘Pray is she at home?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      After another delay, ‘I suppose she is,’ said the voice abruptly; ‘you had
      better come in, and I’ll ask.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were summarily shut into the close black house; and the figure
      rustling away, and speaking from a higher level, said, ‘Come up, if you
      please; you can’t tumble over anything.’ They groped their way up-stairs
      towards a faint light, which proved to be the light of the street shining
      through a window; and the figure left them shut in an airless room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is odd, Clennam,’ said Mr Meagles, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Odd enough,’ assented Clennam in the same tone, ‘but we have succeeded;
      that’s the main point. Here’s a light coming!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was a lamp, and the bearer was an old woman: very dirty, very
      wrinkled and dry. ‘She’s at home,’ she said (and the voice was the same
      that had spoken before); ‘she’ll come directly.’ Having set the lamp down
      on the table, the old woman dusted her hands on her apron, which she might
      have done for ever without cleaning them, looked at the visitors with a
      dim pair of eyes, and backed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady whom they had come to see, if she were the present occupant of
      the house, appeared to have taken up her quarters there as she might have
      established herself in an Eastern caravanserai. A small square of carpet
      in the middle of the room, a few articles of furniture that evidently did
      not belong to the room, and a disorder of trunks and travelling articles,
      formed the whole of her surroundings. Under some former regular
      inhabitant, the stifling little apartment had broken out into a pier-glass
      and a gilt table; but the gilding was as faded as last year’s flowers, and
      the glass was so clouded that it seemed to hold in magic preservation all
      the fogs and bad weather it had ever reflected. The visitors had had a
      minute or two to look about them, when the door opened and Miss Wade came
      in.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was exactly the same as when they had parted, just as handsome, just
      as scornful, just as repressed. She manifested no surprise in seeing them,
      nor any other emotion. She requested them to be seated; and declining to
      take a seat herself, at once anticipated any introduction of their
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I apprehend,’ she said, ‘that I know the cause of your favouring me with
      this visit. We may come to it at once.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The cause then, ma’am,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘is Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So I supposed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Wade,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘will you be so kind as to say whether you
      know anything of her?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Surely. I know she is here with me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then, ma’am,’ said Mr Meagles, ‘allow me to make known to you that I
      shall be happy to have her back, and that my wife and daughter will be
      happy to have her back. She has been with us a long time: we don’t forget
      her claims upon us, and I hope we know how to make allowances.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You hope to know how to make allowances?’ she returned, in a level,
      measured voice. ‘For what?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think my friend would say, Miss Wade,’ Arthur Clennam interposed,
      seeing Mr Meagles rather at a loss, ‘for the passionate sense that
      sometimes comes upon the poor girl, of being at a disadvantage. Which
      occasionally gets the better of better remembrances.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady broke into a smile as she turned her eyes upon him. ‘Indeed?’ was
      all she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood by the table so perfectly composed and still after this
      acknowledgment of his remark that Mr Meagles stared at her under a sort of
      fascination, and could not even look to Clennam to make another move.
      After waiting, awkwardly enough, for some moments, Arthur said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Perhaps it would be well if Mr Meagles could see her, Miss Wade?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That is easily done,’ said she. ‘Come here, child.’ She had opened a door
      while saying this, and now led the girl in by the hand. It was very
      curious to see them standing together: the girl with her disengaged
      fingers plaiting the bosom of her dress, half irresolutely, half
      passionately; Miss Wade with her composed face attentively regarding her,
      and suggesting to an observer, with extraordinary force, in her composure
      itself (as a veil will suggest the form it covers), the unquenchable
      passion of her own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘See here,’ she said, in the same level way as before. ‘Here is your
      patron, your master. He is willing to take you back, my dear, if you are
      sensible of the favour and choose to go. You can be, again, a foil to his
      pretty daughter, a slave to her pleasant wilfulness, and a toy in the
      house showing the goodness of the family. You can have your droll name
      again, playfully pointing you out and setting you apart, as it is right
      that you should be pointed out and set apart. (Your birth, you know; you
      must not forget your birth.) You can again be shown to this gentleman’s
      daughter, Harriet, and kept before her, as a living reminder of her own
      superiority and her gracious condescension. You can recover all these
      advantages and many more of the same kind which I dare say start up in
      your memory while I speak, and which you lose in taking refuge with me—you
      can recover them all by telling these gentlemen how humbled and penitent
      you are, and by going back to them to be forgiven. What do you say,
      Harriet? Will you go?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl who, under the influence of these words, had gradually risen in
      anger and heightened in colour, answered, raising her lustrous black eyes
      for the moment, and clenching her hand upon the folds it had been
      puckering up, ‘I’d die sooner!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wade, still standing at her side holding her hand, looked quietly
      round and said with a smile, ‘Gentlemen! What do you do upon that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mr Meagles’s inexpressible consternation in hearing his motives and
      actions so perverted, had prevented him from interposing any word until
      now; but now he regained the power of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tattycoram,’ said he, ‘for I’ll call you by that name still, my good
      girl, conscious that I meant nothing but kindness when I gave it to you,
      and conscious that you know it—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t!’ said she, looking up again, and almost rending herself with the
      same busy hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, not now, perhaps,’ said Mr Meagles; ‘not with that lady’s eyes so
      intent upon you, Tattycoram,’ she glanced at them for a moment, ‘and that
      power over you, which we see she exercises; not now, perhaps, but at
      another time. Tattycoram, I’ll not ask that lady whether she believes what
      she has said, even in the anger and ill blood in which I and my friend
      here equally know she has spoken, though she subdues herself, with a
      determination that any one who has once seen her is not likely to forget.
      I’ll not ask you, with your remembrance of my house and all belonging to
      it, whether you believe it. I’ll only say that you have no profession to
      make to me or mine, and no forgiveness to entreat; and that all in the
      world that I ask you to do, is, to count five-and-twenty, Tattycoram.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him for an instant, and then said frowningly, ‘I won’t. Miss
      Wade, take me away, please.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The contention that raged within her had no softening in it now; it was
      wholly between passionate defiance and stubborn defiance. Her rich colour,
      her quick blood, her rapid breath, were all setting themselves against the
      opportunity of retracing their steps. ‘I won’t. I won’t. I won’t!’ she
      repeated in a low, thick voice. ‘I’d be torn to pieces first. I’d tear
      myself to pieces first!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wade, who had released her hold, laid her hand protectingly on the
      girl’s neck for a moment, and then said, looking round with her former
      smile and speaking exactly in her former tone, ‘Gentlemen! What do you do
      upon that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, Tattycoram, Tattycoram!’ cried Mr Meagles, adjuring her besides with
      an earnest hand. ‘Hear that lady’s voice, look at that lady’s face,
      consider what is in that lady’s heart, and think what a future lies before
      you. My child, whatever you may think, that lady’s influence over you—astonishing
      to us, and I should hardly go too far in saying terrible to us to see—is
      founded in passion fiercer than yours, and temper more violent than yours.
      What can you two be together? What can come of it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am alone here, gentlemen,’ observed Miss Wade, with no change of voice
      or manner. ‘Say anything you will.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Politeness must yield to this misguided girl, ma’am,’ said Mr Meagles,
      ‘at her present pass; though I hope not altogether to dismiss it, even
      with the injury you do her so strongly before me. Excuse me for reminding
      you in her hearing—I must say it—that you were a mystery to
      all of us, and had nothing in common with any of us when she unfortunately
      fell in your way. I don’t know what you are, but you don’t hide, can’t
      hide, what a dark spirit you have within you. If it should happen that you
      are a woman, who, from whatever cause, has a perverted delight in making a
      sister-woman as wretched as she is (I am old enough to have heard of
      such), I warn her against you, and I warn you against yourself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Gentlemen!’ said Miss Wade, calmly. ‘When you have concluded—Mr
      Clennam, perhaps you will induce your friend—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not without another effort,’ said Mr Meagles, stoutly. ‘Tattycoram, my
      poor dear girl, count five-and-twenty.’ 
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0296m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0296m " /><br />

      <a href="images/0296.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      ‘Do not reject the hope, the certainty, this kind man offers you,’ said
      Clennam in a low emphatic voice. ‘Turn to the friends you have not
      forgotten. Think once more!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I won’t! Miss Wade,’ said the girl, with her bosom swelling high, and
      speaking with her hand held to her throat, ‘take me away!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tattycoram,’ said Mr Meagles. ‘Once more yet! The only thing I ask of you
      in the world, my child! Count five-and-twenty!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands tightly over her ears, confusedly tumbling down her
      bright black hair in the vehemence of the action, and turned her face
      resolutely to the wall. Miss Wade, who had watched her under this final
      appeal with that strange attentive smile, and that repressing hand upon
      her own bosom with which she had watched her in her struggle at
      Marseilles, then put her arm about her waist as if she took possession of
      her for evermore.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was a visible triumph in her face when she turned it to dismiss
      the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As it is the last time I shall have the honour,’ she said, ‘and as you
      have spoken of not knowing what I am, and also of the foundation of my
      influence here, you may now know that it is founded in a common cause.
      What your broken plaything is as to birth, I am. She has no name, I have
      no name. Her wrong is my wrong. I have nothing more to say to you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to Mr Meagles, who sorrowfully went out. As Clennam
      followed, she said to him, with the same external composure and in the
      same level voice, but with a smile that is only seen on cruel faces: a
      very faint smile, lifting the nostril, scarcely touching the lips, and not
      breaking away gradually, but instantly dismissed when done with:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope the wife of your dear friend Mr Gowan, may be happy in the
      contrast of her extraction to this girl’s and mine, and in the high good
      fortune that awaits her.’

	</hgroup>
<p>Not resting satisfied with the endeavours he had made to recover his lost
      charge, Mr Meagles addressed a letter of remonstrance, breathing nothing
      but goodwill, not only to her, but to Miss Wade too. No answer coming to
      these epistles, or to another written to the stubborn girl by the hand of
      her late young mistress, which might have melted her if anything could
      (all three letters were returned weeks afterwards as having been refused
      at the house-door), he deputed Mrs Meagles to make the experiment of a
      personal interview. That worthy lady being unable to obtain one, and being
      steadfastly denied admission, Mr Meagles besought Arthur to essay once
      more what he could do. All that came of his compliance was, his discovery
      that the empty house was left in charge of the old woman, that Miss Wade
      was gone, that the waifs and strays of furniture were gone, and that the
      old woman would accept any number of half-crowns and thank the donor
      kindly, but had no information whatever to exchange for those coins,
      beyond constantly offering for perusal a memorandum relative to fixtures,
      which the house-agent’s young man had left in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unwilling, even under this discomfiture, to resign the ingrate and leave
      her hopeless, in case of her better dispositions obtaining the mastery
      over the darker side of her character, Mr Meagles, for six successive
      days, published a discreetly covert advertisement in the morning papers,
      to the effect that if a certain young person who had lately left home
      without reflection, would at any time apply to his address at Twickenham,
      everything would be as it had been before, and no reproaches need be
      apprehended. The unexpected consequences of this notification suggested to
      the dismayed Mr Meagles for the first time that some hundreds of young
      persons must be leaving their homes without reflection every day; for
      shoals of wrong young people came down to Twickenham, who, not finding
      themselves received with enthusiasm, generally demanded compensation by
      way of damages, in addition to coach-hire there and back. Nor were these
      the only uninvited clients whom the advertisement produced. The swarm of
      begging-letter writers, who would seem to be always watching eagerly for
      any hook, however small, to hang a letter upon, wrote to say that having
      seen the advertisement, they were induced to apply with confidence for
      various sums, ranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds: not because they
      knew anything about the young person, but because they felt that to part
      with those donations would greatly relieve the advertiser’s mind. Several
      projectors, likewise, availed themselves of the same opportunity to
      correspond with Mr Meagles; as, for example, to apprise him that their
      attention having been called to the advertisement by a friend, they begged
      to state that if they should ever hear anything of the young person, they
      would not fail to make it known to him immediately, and that in the
      meantime if he would oblige them with the funds necessary for bringing to
      perfection a certain entirely novel description of Pump, the happiest
      results would ensue to mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles and his family, under these combined discouragements, had begun
      reluctantly to give up Tattycoram as irrecoverable, when the new and
      active firm of Doyce and Clennam, in their private capacities, went down
      on a Saturday to stay at the cottage until Monday. The senior partner took
      the coach, and the junior partner took his walking-stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tranquil summer sunset shone upon him as he approached the end of his
      walk, and passed through the meadows by the river side. He had that sense
      of peace, and of being lightened of a weight of care, which country quiet
      awakens in the breasts of dwellers in towns. Everything within his view
      was lovely and placid. The rich foliage of the trees, the luxuriant grass
      diversified with wild flowers, the little green islands in the river, the
      beds of rushes, the water-lilies floating on the surface of the stream,
      the distant voices in boats borne musically towards him on the ripple of
      the water and the evening air, were all expressive of rest. In the
      occasional leap of a fish, or dip of an oar, or twittering of a bird not
      yet at roost, or distant barking of a dog, or lowing of a cow—in all
      such sounds, there was the prevailing breath of rest, which seemed to
      encompass him in every scent that sweetened the fragrant air. The long
      lines of red and gold in the sky, and the glorious track of the descending
      sun, were all divinely calm. Upon the purple tree-tops far away, and on
      the green height near at hand up which the shades were slowly creeping,
      there was an equal hush. Between the real landscape and its shadow in the
      water, there was no division; both were so untroubled and clear, and,
      while so fraught with solemn mystery of life and death, so hopefully
      reassuring to the gazer’s soothed heart, because so tenderly and
      mercifully beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam had stopped, not for the first time by many times, to look about
      him and suffer what he saw to sink into his soul, as the shadows, looked
      at, seemed to sink deeper and deeper into the water. He was slowly
      resuming his way, when he saw a figure in the path before him which he
      had, perhaps, already associated with the evening and its impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minnie was there, alone. She had some roses in her hand, and seemed to
      have stood still on seeing him, waiting for him. Her face was towards him,
      and she appeared to have been coming from the opposite direction. There
      was a flutter in her manner, which Clennam had never seen in it before;
      and as he came near her, it entered his mind all at once that she was
      there of a set purpose to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand, and said, ‘You wonder to see me here by myself? But
      the evening is so lovely, I have strolled further than I meant at first. I
      thought it likely I might meet you, and that made me more confident. You
      always come this way, do you not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Clennam said that it was his favourite way, he felt her hand falter on
      his arm, and saw the roses shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you let me give you one, Mr Clennam? I gathered them as I came out
      of the garden. Indeed, I almost gathered them for you, thinking it so
      likely I might meet you. Mr Doyce arrived more than an hour ago, and told
      us you were walking down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His own hand shook, as he accepted a rose or two from hers and thanked
      her. They were now by an avenue of trees. Whether they turned into it on
      his movement or on hers matters little. He never knew how that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is very grave here,’ said Clennam, ‘but very pleasant at this hour.
      Passing along this deep shade, and out at that arch of light at the other
      end, we come upon the ferry and the cottage by the best approach, I
      think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In her simple garden-hat and her light summer dress, with her rich brown
      hair naturally clustering about her, and her wonderful eyes raised to his
      for a moment with a look in which regard for him and trustfulness in him
      were strikingly blended with a kind of timid sorrow for him, she was so
      beautiful that it was well for his peace—or ill for his peace, he
      did not quite know which—that he had made that vigorous resolution
      he had so often thought about.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke a momentary silence by inquiring if he knew that papa had been
      thinking of another tour abroad? He said he had heard it mentioned. She
      broke another momentary silence by adding, with some hesitation, that papa
      had abandoned the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, he thought directly, ‘they are to be married.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam,’ she said, hesitating more timidly yet, and speaking so low
      that he bent his head to hear her. ‘I should very much like to give you my
      confidence, if you would not mind having the goodness to receive it. I
      should have very much liked to have given it to you long ago, because—I
      felt that you were becoming so much our friend.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How can I be otherwise than proud of it at any time! Pray give it to me.
      Pray trust me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I could never have been afraid of trusting you,’ she returned, raising
      her eyes frankly to his face. ‘I think I would have done so some time ago,
      if I had known how. But I scarcely know how, even now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Gowan,’ said Arthur Clennam, ‘has reason to be very happy. God bless
      his wife and him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept, as she tried to thank him. He reassured her, took her hand as it
      lay with the trembling roses in it on his arm, took the remaining roses
      from it, and put it to his lips. At that time, it seemed to him, he first
      finally resigned the dying hope that had flickered in nobody’s heart so
      much to its pain and trouble; and from that time he became in his own
      eyes, as to any similar hope or prospect, a very much older man who had
      done with that part of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the roses in his breast and they walked on for a little while,
      slowly and silently, under the umbrageous trees. Then he asked her, in a
      voice of cheerful kindness, was there anything else that she would say to
      him as her friend and her father’s friend, many years older than herself;
      was there any trust she would repose in him, any service she would ask of
      him, any little aid to her happiness that she could give him the lasting
      gratification of believing it was in his power to render?
    </p>
    <p>
      She was going to answer, when she was so touched by some little hidden
      sorrow or sympathy—what could it have been?—that she said,
      bursting into tears again: ‘O Mr Clennam! Good, generous, Mr Clennam, pray
      tell me you do not blame me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I blame you?’ said Clennam. ‘My dearest girl! I blame you? No!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      After clasping both her hands upon his arm, and looking confidentially up
      into his face, with some hurried words to the effect that she thanked him
      from her heart (as she did, if it be the source of earnestness), she
      gradually composed herself, with now and then a word of encouragement from
      him, as they walked on slowly and almost silently under the darkening
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And, now, Minnie Gowan,’ at length said Clennam, smiling; ‘will you ask
      me nothing?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! I have very much to ask of you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s well! I hope so; I am not disappointed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You know how I am loved at home, and how I love home. You can hardly
      think it perhaps, dear Mr Clennam,’ she spoke with great agitation,
      ‘seeing me going from it of my own free will and choice, but I do so
      dearly love it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sure of that,’ said Clennam. ‘Can you suppose I doubt it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no. But it is strange, even to me, that loving it so much and being
      so much beloved in it, I can bear to cast it away. It seems so neglectful
      of it, so unthankful.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear girl,’ said Clennam, ‘it is in the natural progress and change of
      time. All homes are left so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I know; but all homes are not left with such a blank in them as
      there will be in mine when I am gone. Not that there is any scarcity of
      far better and more endearing and more accomplished girls than I am; not
      that I am much, but that they have made so much of me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pet’s affectionate heart was overcharged, and she sobbed while she
      pictured what would happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know what a change papa will feel at first, and I know that at first I
      cannot be to him anything like what I have been these many years. And it
      is then, Mr Clennam, then more than at any time, that I beg and entreat
      you to remember him, and sometimes to keep him company when you can spare
      a little while; and to tell him that you know I was fonder of him when I
      left him, than I ever was in all my life. For there is nobody—he
      told me so himself when he talked to me this very day—there is
      nobody he likes so well as you, or trusts so much.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      A clue to what had passed between the father and daughter dropped like a
      heavy stone into the well of Clennam’s heart, and swelled the water to his
      eyes. He said, cheerily, but not quite so cheerily as he tried to say,
      that it should be done—that he gave her his faithful promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I do not speak of mama,’ said Pet, more moved by, and more pretty in,
      her innocent grief, than Clennam could trust himself even to consider—for
      which reason he counted the trees between them and the fading light as
      they slowly diminished in number—‘it is because mama will understand
      me better in this action, and will feel my loss in a different way, and
      will look forward in a different manner. But you know what a dear, devoted
      mother she is, and you will remember her too; will you not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let Minnie trust him, Clennam said, let Minnie trust him to do all she
      wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And, dear Mr Clennam,’ said Minnie, ‘because papa and one whom I need not
      name, do not fully appreciate and understand one another yet, as they will
      by-and-by; and because it will be the duty, and the pride, and pleasure of
      my new life, to draw them to a better knowledge of one another, and to be
      a happiness to one another, and to be proud of one another, and to love
      one another, both loving me so dearly; oh, as you are a kind, true man!
      when I am first separated from home (I am going a long distance away), try
      to reconcile papa to him a little more, and use your great influence to
      keep him before papa’s mind free from prejudice and in his real form. Will
      you do this for me, as you are a noble-hearted friend?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Pet! Self-deceived, mistaken child! When were such changes ever made
      in men’s natural relations to one another: when was such reconcilement of
      ingrain differences ever effected! It has been tried many times by other
      daughters, Minnie; it has never succeeded; nothing has ever come of it but
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Clennam thought. So he did not say; it was too late. He bound himself
      to do all she asked, and she knew full well that he would do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now at the last tree in the avenue. She stopped, and withdrew
      her arm. Speaking to him with her eyes lifted up to his, and with the hand
      that had lately rested on his sleeve trembling by touching one of the
      roses in his breast as an additional appeal to him, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear Mr Clennam, in my happiness—for I am happy, though you have
      seen me crying—I cannot bear to leave any cloud between us. If you
      have anything to forgive me (not anything that I have wilfully done, but
      any trouble I may have caused you without meaning it, or having it in my
      power to help it), forgive me to-night out of your noble heart!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped to meet the guileless face that met his without shrinking. He
      kissed it, and answered, Heaven knew that he had nothing to forgive. As he
      stooped to meet the innocent face once again, she whispered, ‘Good-bye!’ 
      and he repeated it. It was taking leave of all his old hopes—all
      nobody’s old restless doubts. They came out of the avenue next moment,
      arm-in-arm as they had entered it: and the trees seemed to close up behind
      them in the darkness, like their own perspective of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voices of Mr and Mrs Meagles and Doyce were audible directly, speaking
      near the garden gate. Hearing Pet’s name among them, Clennam called out,
      ‘She is here, with me.’ There was some little wondering and laughing until
      they came up; but as soon as they had all come together, it ceased, and
      Pet glided away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles, Doyce, and Clennam, without speaking, walked up and down on
      the brink of the river, in the light of the rising moon, for a few
      minutes; and then Doyce lingered behind, and went into the house. Mr
      Meagles and Clennam walked up and down together for a few minutes more
      without speaking, until at length the former broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Arthur,’ said he, using that familiar address for the first time in their
      communication, ‘do you remember my telling you, as we walked up and down
      one hot morning, looking over the harbour at Marseilles, that Pet’s baby
      sister who was dead seemed to Mother and me to have grown as she had
      grown, and changed as she had changed?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You remember my saying that our thoughts had never been able to separate
      those twin sisters, and that, in our fancy, whatever Pet was, the other
      was?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, very well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Arthur,’ said Mr Meagles, much subdued, ‘I carry that fancy further
      to-night. I feel to-night, my dear fellow, as if you had loved my dead
      child very tenderly, and had lost her when she was like what Pet is now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you!’ murmured Clennam, ‘thank you!’ And pressed his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you come in?’ said Mr Meagles, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In a little while.’ 
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0305m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0305m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0305.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr Meagles fell away, and he was left alone. When he had walked on the
      river’s brink in the peaceful moonlight for some half an hour, he put his
      hand in his breast and tenderly took out the handful of roses. Perhaps he
      put them to his heart, perhaps he put them to his lips, but certainly he
      bent down on the shore and gently launched them on the flowing river. Pale
      and unreal in the moonlight, the river floated them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights were bright within doors when he entered, and the faces on
      which they shone, his own face not excepted, were soon quietly cheerful.
      They talked of many subjects (his partner never had had such a ready store
      to draw upon for the beguiling of the time), and so to bed, and to sleep.
      While the flowers, pale and unreal in the moonlight, floated away upon the
      river; and thus do greater things that once were in our breasts, and near
      our hearts, flow from us to the eternal seas.

	<h3 epub:type="title">Mrs Flintwinch goes on Dreaming</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these
      transactions, and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of
      life. Morning, noon, and night, morning, noon, and night, each recurring
      with its accompanying monotony, always the same reluctant return of the
      same sequences of machinery, like a dragging piece of clockwork.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheeled chair had its associated remembrances and reveries, one may
      suppose, as every place that is made the station of a human being has.
      Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses, as they formerly were
      when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them, images of people as
      they too used to be, with little or no allowance made for the lapse of
      time since they were seen; of these, there must have been many in the long
      routine of gloomy days. To stop the clock of busy existence at the hour
      when we were personally sequestered from it, to suppose mankind stricken
      motionless when we were brought to a stand-still, to be unable to measure
      the changes beyond our view by any larger standard than the shrunken one
      of our own uniform and contracted existence, is the infirmity of many
      invalids, and the mental unhealthiness of almost all recluses.
    </p>
    <p>
      What scenes and actors the stern woman most reviewed, as she sat from
      season to season in her one dark room, none knew but herself. Mr
      Flintwinch, with his wry presence brought to bear upon her daily like some
      eccentric mechanical force, would perhaps have screwed it out of her, if
      there had been less resistance in her; but she was too strong for him. So
      far as Mistress Affery was concerned, to regard her liege-lord and her
      disabled mistress with a face of blank wonder, to go about the house after
      dark with her apron over her head, always to listen for the strange noises
      and sometimes to hear them, and never to emerge from her ghostly, dreamy,
      sleep-waking state, was occupation enough for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fair stroke of business doing, as Mistress Affery made out,
      for her husband had abundant occupation in his little office, and saw more
      people than had been used to come there for some years. This might easily
      be, the house having been long deserted; but he did receive letters, and
      comers, and keep books, and correspond. Moreover, he went about to other
      counting-houses, and to wharves, and docks, and to the Custom House, and
      to Garraway’s Coffee House, and the Jerusalem Coffee House, and on
      ‘Change; so that he was much in and out. He began, too, sometimes of an
      evening, when Mrs Clennam expressed no particular wish for his society, to
      resort to a tavern in the neighbourhood to look at the shipping news and
      closing prices in the evening paper, and even to exchange small
      socialities with mercantile Sea Captains who frequented that
      establishment. At some period of every day, he and Mrs Clennam held a
      council on matters of business; and it appeared to Affery, who was always
      groping about, listening and watching, that the two clever ones were
      making money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state of mind into which Mr Flintwinch’s dazed lady had fallen, had
      now begun to be so expressed in all her looks and actions that she was
      held in very low account by the two clever ones, as a person, never of
      strong intellect, who was becoming foolish. Perhaps because her appearance
      was not of a commercial cast, or perhaps because it occurred to him that
      his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the
      minds of customers, Mr Flintwinch laid his commands upon her that she
      should hold her peace on the subject of her conjugal relations, and should
      no longer call him Jeremiah out of the domestic trio. Her frequent
      forgetfulness of this admonition intensified her startled manner, since Mr
      Flintwinch’s habit of avenging himself on her remissness by making springs
      after her on the staircase, and shaking her, occasioned her to be always
      nervously uncertain when she might be thus waylaid next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit had finished a long day’s work in Mrs Clennam’s room, and
      was neatly gathering up her shreds and odds and ends before going home. Mr
      Pancks, whom Affery had just shown in, was addressing an inquiry to Mrs
      Clennam on the subject of her health, coupled with the remark that,
      ‘happening to find himself in that direction,’ he had looked in to
      inquire, on behalf of his proprietor, how she found herself. Mrs Clennam,
      with a deep contraction of her brows, was looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Casby knows,’ said she, ‘that I am not subject to changes. The change
      that I await here is the great change.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed, ma’am?’ returned Mr Pancks, with a wandering eye towards the
      figure of the little seamstress on her knee picking threads and fraying of
      her work from the carpet. ‘You look nicely, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I bear what I have to bear,’ she answered. ‘Do you what you have to do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ said Mr Pancks, ‘such is my endeavour.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are often in this direction, are you not?’ asked Mrs Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, yes, ma’am,’ said Pancks, ‘rather so lately; I have lately been
      round this way a good deal, owing to one thing and another.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Beg Mr Casby and his daughter not to trouble themselves, by deputy, about
      me. When they wish to see me, they know I am here to see them. They have
      no need to trouble themselves to send. You have no need to trouble
      yourself to come.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not the least trouble, ma’am,’ said Mr Pancks. ‘You really are looking
      uncommonly nicely, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you. Good evening.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dismissal, and its accompanying finger pointed straight at the door,
      was so curt and direct that Mr Pancks did not see his way to prolong his
      visit. He stirred up his hair with his sprightliest expression, glanced at
      the little figure again, said ‘Good evening, ma ‘am; don’t come down, Mrs
      Affery, I know the road to the door,’ and steamed out. Mrs Clennam, her
      chin resting on her hand, followed him with attentive and darkly
      distrustful eyes; and Affery stood looking at her as if she were
      spell-bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and thoughtfully, Mrs Clennam’s eyes turned from the door by which
      Pancks had gone out, to Little Dorrit, rising from the carpet. With her
      chin drooping more heavily on her hand, and her eyes vigilant and
      lowering, the sick woman sat looking at her until she attracted her
      attention. Little Dorrit coloured under such a gaze, and looked down. Mrs
      Clennam still sat intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little Dorrit,’ she said, when she at last broke silence, ‘what do you
      know of that man?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know anything of him, ma’am, except that I have seen him about,
      and that he has spoken to me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What has he said to you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t understand what he has said, he is so strange. But nothing rough
      or disagreeable.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why does he come here to see you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know, ma’am,’ said Little Dorrit, with perfect frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You know that he does come here to see you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have fancied so,’ said Little Dorrit. ‘But why he should come here or
      anywhere for that, ma’am, I can’t think.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam cast her eyes towards the ground, and with her strong, set
      face, as intent upon a subject in her mind as it had lately been upon the
      form that seemed to pass out of her view, sat absorbed. Some minutes
      elapsed before she came out of this thoughtfulness, and resumed her hard
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit in the meanwhile had been waiting to go, but afraid to
      disturb her by moving. She now ventured to leave the spot where she had
      been standing since she had risen, and to pass gently round by the wheeled
      chair. She stopped at its side to say ‘Good night, ma’am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam put out her hand, and laid it on her arm. Little Dorrit,
      confused under the touch, stood faltering. Perhaps some momentary
      recollection of the story of the Princess may have been in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tell me, Little Dorrit,’ said Mrs Clennam, ‘have you many friends now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very few, ma’am. Besides you, only Miss Flora and—one more.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Meaning,’ said Mrs Clennam, with her unbent finger again pointing to the
      door, ‘that man?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh no, ma’am!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Some friend of his, perhaps?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No ma’am.’ Little Dorrit earnestly shook her head. ‘Oh no! No one at all
      like him, or belonging to him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ said Mrs Clennam, almost smiling. ‘It is no affair of mine. I ask,
      because I take an interest in you; and because I believe I was your friend
      when you had no other who could serve you. Is that so?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, ma’am; indeed it is. I have been here many a time when, but for you
      and the work you gave me, we should have wanted everything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We,’ repeated Mrs Clennam, looking towards the watch, once her dead
      husband’s, which always lay upon her table. ‘Are there many of you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Only father and I, now. I mean, only father and I to keep regularly out
      of what we get.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Have you undergone many privations? You and your father and who else
      there may be of you?’ asked Mrs Clennam, speaking deliberately, and
      meditatively turning the watch over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sometimes it has been rather hard to live,’ said Little Dorrit, in her
      soft voice, and timid uncomplaining way; ‘but I think not harder—as
      to that—than many people find it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s well said!’ Mrs Clennam quickly returned. ‘That’s the truth! You
      are a good, thoughtful girl. You are a grateful girl too, or I much
      mistake you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is only natural to be that. There is no merit in being that,’ said
      Little Dorrit. ‘I am indeed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Clennam, with a gentleness of which the dreaming Affery had never
      dreamed her to be capable, drew down the face of her little seamstress,
      and kissed her on the forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now go, Little Dorrit,’ said she, ‘or you will be late, poor child!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the dreams Mistress Affery had been piling up since she first
      became devoted to the pursuit, she had dreamed nothing more astonishing
      than this. Her head ached with the idea that she would find the other
      clever one kissing Little Dorrit next, and then the two clever ones
      embracing each other and dissolving into tears of tenderness for all
      mankind. The idea quite stunned her, as she attended the light footsteps
      down the stairs, that the house door might be safely shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      On opening it to let Little Dorrit out, she found Mr Pancks, instead of
      having gone his way, as in any less wonderful place and among less
      wonderful phenomena he might have been reasonably expected to do,
      fluttering up and down the court outside the house. The moment he saw
      Little Dorrit, he passed her briskly, said with his finger to his nose (as
      Mrs Affery distinctly heard), ‘Pancks the gipsy, fortune-telling,’ and
      went away. ‘Lord save us, here’s a gipsy and a fortune-teller in it now!’ 
      cried Mistress Affery. ‘What next!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the open door, staggering herself with this enigma, on a
      rainy, thundery evening. The clouds were flying fast, and the wind was
      coming up in gusts, banging some neighbouring shutters that had broken
      loose, twirling the rusty chimney-cowls and weather-cocks, and rushing
      round and round a confined adjacent churchyard as if it had a mind to blow
      the dead citizens out of their graves. The low thunder, muttering in all
      quarters of the sky at once, seemed to threaten vengeance for this
      attempted desecration, and to mutter, ‘Let them rest! Let them rest!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery, whose fear of thunder and lightning was only to be
      equalled by her dread of the haunted house with a premature and
      preternatural darkness in it, stood undecided whether to go in or not,
      until the question was settled for her by the door blowing upon her in a
      violent gust of wind and shutting her out. ‘What’s to be done now, what’s
      to be done now!’ cried Mistress Affery, wringing her hands in this last
      uneasy dream of all; ‘when she’s all alone by herself inside, and can no
      more come down to open it than the churchyard dead themselves!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this dilemma, Mistress Affery, with her apron as a hood to keep the
      rain off, ran crying up and down the solitary paved enclosure several
      times. Why she should then stoop down and look in at the keyhole of the
      door as if an eye would open it, it would be difficult to say; but it is
      none the less what most people would have done in the same situation, and
      it is what she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this posture she started up suddenly, with a half scream, feeling
      something on her shoulder. It was the touch of a hand; of a man’s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was dressed like a traveller, in a foraging cap with fur about it,
      and a heap of cloak. He looked like a foreigner. He had a quantity of hair
      and moustache—jet black, except at the shaggy ends, where it had a
      tinge of red—and a high hook nose. He laughed at Mistress Affery’s
      start and cry; and as he laughed, his moustache went up under his nose,
      and his nose came down over his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What’s the matter?’ he asked in plain English. ‘What are you frightened
      at?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘At you,’ panted Affery.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Me, madam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And the dismal evening, and—and everything,’ said Affery. ‘And
      here! The wind has been and blown the door to, and I can’t get in.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hah!’ said the gentleman, who took that very coolly. ‘Indeed! Do you know
      such a name as Clennam about here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lord bless us, I should think I did, I should think I did!’ cried Affery,
      exasperated into a new wringing of hands by the inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where about here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where!’ cried Affery, goaded into another inspection of the keyhole.
      ‘Where but here in this house? And she’s all alone in her room, and lost
      the use of her limbs and can’t stir to help herself or me, and t’other
      clever one’s out, and Lord forgive me!’ cried Affery, driven into a
      frantic dance by these accumulated considerations, ‘if I ain’t a-going
      headlong out of my mind!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking a warmer view of the matter now that it concerned himself, the
      gentleman stepped back to glance at the house, and his eye soon rested on
      the long narrow window of the little room near the hall-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Where may the lady be who has lost the use of her limbs, madam?’ he
      inquired, with that peculiar smile which Mistress Affery could not choose
      but keep her eyes upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Up there!’ said Affery. ‘Them two windows.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hah! I am of a fair size, but could not have the honour of presenting
      myself in that room without a ladder. Now, madam, frankly—frankness
      is a part of my character—shall I open the door for you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, bless you, sir, for a dear creetur, and do it at once,’ cried
      Affery, ‘for she may be a-calling to me at this very present minute, or
      may be setting herself a fire and burning herself to death, or there’s no
      knowing what may be happening to her, and me a-going out of my mind at
      thinking of it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay, my good madam!’ He restrained her impatience with a smooth white
      hand. ‘Business-hours, I apprehend, are over for the day?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes, yes,’ cried Affery. ‘Long ago.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let me make, then, a fair proposal. Fairness is a part of my character. I
      am just landed from the packet-boat, as you may see.’ He showed her that
      his cloak was very wet, and that his boots were saturated with water; she
      had previously observed that he was dishevelled and sallow, as if from a
      rough voyage, and so chilled that he could not keep his teeth from
      chattering. ‘I am just landed from the packet-boat, madam, and have been
      delayed by the weather: the infernal weather! In consequence of this,
      madam, some necessary business that I should otherwise have transacted
      here within the regular hours (necessary business because money-business),
      still remains to be done. Now, if you will fetch any authorised
      neighbouring somebody to do it in return for my opening the door, I’ll
      open the door. If this arrangement should be objectionable, I’ll—’ 
      and with the same smile he made a significant feint of backing away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery, heartily glad to effect the proposed compromise, gave in
      her willing adhesion to it. The gentleman at once requested her to do him
      the favour of holding his cloak, took a short run at the narrow window,
      made a leap at the sill, clung his way up the bricks, and in a moment had
      his hand at the sash, raising it. His eyes looked so very sinister, as he
      put his leg into the room and glanced round at Mistress Affery, that she
      thought with a sudden coldness, if he were to go straight up-stairs to
      murder the invalid, what could she do to prevent him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily he had no such purpose; for he reappeared, in a moment, at the
      house door. ‘Now, my dear madam,’ he said, as he took back his cloak and
      threw it on, ‘if you have the goodness to—what the Devil’s that!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The strangest of sounds. Evidently close at hand from the peculiar shock
      it communicated to the air, yet subdued as if it were far off. A tremble,
      a rumble, and a fall of some light dry matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What the Devil is it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know what it is, but I’ve heard the like of it over and over
      again,’ said Affery, who had caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hardly be a very brave man, even she thought in her dreamy start
      and fright, for his trembling lips had turned colourless. After listening
      a few moments, he made light of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Bah! Nothing! Now, my dear madam, I think you spoke of some clever
      personage. Will you be so good as to confront me with that genius?’ He
      held the door in his hand, as though he were quite ready to shut her out
      again if she failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t you say anything about the door and me, then,’ whispered Affery.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not a word.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And don’t you stir from here, or speak if she calls, while I run round
      the corner.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Madam, I am a statue.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Affery had so vivid a fear of his going stealthily up-stairs the moment
      her back was turned, that after hurrying out of sight, she returned to the
      gateway to peep at him. Seeing him still on the threshold, more out of the
      house than in it, as if he had no love for darkness and no desire to probe
      its mysteries, she flew into the next street, and sent a message into the
      tavern to Mr Flintwinch, who came out directly. The two returning together—the
      lady in advance, and Mr Flintwinch coming up briskly behind, animated with
      the hope of shaking her before she could get housed—saw the
      gentleman standing in the same place in the dark, and heard the strong
      voice of Mrs Clennam calling from her room, ‘Who is it? What is it? Why
      does no one answer? Who <i>is</i> that, down there?’

<p>When Mr and Mrs Flintwinch panted up to the door of the old house in the
      twilight, Jeremiah within a second of Affery, the stranger started back.
      ‘Death of my soul!’ he exclaimed. ‘Why, how did you get here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, to whom these words were spoken, repaid the stranger’s
      wonder in full. He gazed at him with blank astonishment; he looked over
      his own shoulder, as expecting to see some one he had not been aware of
      standing behind him; he gazed at the stranger again, speechlessly, at a
      loss to know what he meant; he looked to his wife for explanation;
      receiving none, he pounced upon her, and shook her with such heartiness
      that he shook her cap off her head, saying between his teeth, with grim
      raillery, as he did it, ‘Affery, my woman, you must have a dose, my woman!
      This is some of your tricks! You have been dreaming again, mistress.
      What’s it about? Who is it? What does it mean! Speak out or be choked!
      It’s the only choice I’ll give you.’ 
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0314m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0314m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0314.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Supposing Mistress Affery to have any power of election at the moment, her
      choice was decidedly to be choked; for she answered not a syllable to this
      adjuration, but, with her bare head wagging violently backwards and
      forwards, resigned herself to her punishment. The stranger, however,
      picking up her cap with an air of gallantry, interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Permit me,’ said he, laying his hand on the shoulder of Jeremiah, who
      stopped and released his victim. ‘Thank you. Excuse me. Husband and wife I
      know, from this playfulness. Haha! Always agreeable to see that relation
      playfully maintained. Listen! May I suggest that somebody up-stairs, in
      the dark, is becoming energetically curious to know what is going on
      here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This reference to Mrs Clennam’s voice reminded Mr Flintwinch to step into
      the hall and call up the staircase. ‘It’s all right, I am here, Affery is
      coming with your light.’ Then he said to the latter flustered woman, who
      was putting her cap on, ‘Get out with you, and get up-stairs!’ and then
      turned to the stranger and said to him, ‘Now, sir, what might you please
      to want?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am afraid,’ said the stranger, ‘I must be so troublesome as to propose
      a candle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True,’ assented Jeremiah. ‘I was going to do so. Please to stand where
      you are while I get one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor was standing in the doorway, but turned a little into the
      gloom of the house as Mr Flintwinch turned, and pursued him with his eyes
      into the little room, where he groped about for a phosphorus box. When he
      found it, it was damp, or otherwise out of order; and match after match
      that he struck into it lighted sufficiently to throw a dull glare about
      his groping face, and to sprinkle his hands with pale little spots of
      fire, but not sufficiently to light the candle. The stranger, taking
      advantage of this fitful illumination of his visage, looked intently and
      wonderingly at him. Jeremiah, when he at last lighted the candle, knew he
      had been doing this, by seeing the last shade of a lowering watchfulness
      clear away from his face, as it broke into the doubtful smile that was a
      large ingredient in its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Be so good,’ said Jeremiah, closing the house door, and taking a pretty
      sharp survey of the smiling visitor in his turn, ‘as to step into my
      counting-house.—It’s all right, I tell you!’ petulantly breaking off
      to answer the voice up-stairs, still unsatisfied, though Affery was there,
      speaking in persuasive tones. ‘Don’t I tell you it’s all right? Preserve
      the woman, has she no reason at all in her!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Timorous,’ remarked the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Timorous?’ said Mr Flintwinch, turning his head to retort, as he went
      before with the candle. ‘More courageous than ninety men in a hundred,
      sir, let me tell you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Though an invalid?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Many years an invalid. Mrs Clennam. The only one of that name left in the
      House now. My partner.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying something apologetically as he crossed the hall, to the effect that
      at that time of night they were not in the habit of receiving any one, and
      were always shut up, Mr Flintwinch led the way into his own office, which
      presented a sufficiently business-like appearance. Here he put the light
      on his desk, and said to the stranger, with his wryest twist upon him,
      ‘Your commands.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My name is Blandois.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Blandois. I don’t know it,’ said Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thought it possible,’ resumed the other, ‘that you might have been
      advised from Paris—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We have had no advice from Paris respecting anybody of the name of
      Blandois,’ said Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah stood in his favourite attitude. The smiling Mr Blandois, opening
      his cloak to get his hand to a breast-pocket, paused to say, with a laugh
      in his glittering eyes, which it occurred to Mr Flintwinch were too near
      together:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are so like a friend of mine! Not so identically the same as I
      supposed when I really did for the moment take you to be the same in the
      dusk—for which I ought to apologise; permit me to do so; a readiness
      to confess my errors is, I hope, a part of the frankness of my character—still,
      however, uncommonly like.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed?’ said Jeremiah, perversely. ‘But I have not received any letter
      of advice from anywhere respecting anybody of the name of Blandois.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Just so,’ said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘<i>Just</i> so,’ said Jeremiah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois, not at all put out by this omission on the part of the
      correspondents of the house of Clennam and Co., took his pocket-book from
      his breast-pocket, selected a letter from that receptacle, and handed it
      to Mr Flintwinch. ‘No doubt you are well acquainted with the writing.
      Perhaps the letter speaks for itself, and requires no advice. You are a
      far more competent judge of such affairs than I am. It is my misfortune to
      be, not so much a man of business, as what the world calls (arbitrarily) a
      gentleman.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch took the letter, and read, under date of Paris, ‘We have to
      present to you, on behalf of a highly esteemed correspondent of our Firm,
      M. Blandois, of this city,’ &amp;c. &amp;c. ‘Such facilities as he may
      require and such attentions as may lie in your power,’ &amp;c. &amp;c.
      ‘Also have to add that if you will honour M. Blandois’ drafts at sight to
      the extent of, say Fifty Pounds sterling (50<i>l</i>.),’ &amp;c. &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very good, sir,’ said Mr Flintwinch. ‘Take a chair. To the extent of
      anything that our House can do—we are in a retired, old-fashioned,
      steady way of business, sir—we shall be happy to render you our best
      assistance. I observe, from the date of this, that we could not yet be
      advised of it. Probably you came over with the delayed mail that brings
      the advice.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That I came over with the delayed mail, sir,’ returned Mr Blandois,
      passing his white hand down his high-hooked nose, ‘I know to the cost of
      my head and stomach: the detestable and intolerable weather having racked
      them both. You see me in the plight in which I came out of the packet
      within this half-hour. I ought to have been here hours ago, and then I
      should not have to apologise—permit me to apologise—for
      presenting myself so unreasonably, and frightening—no, by-the-bye,
      you said not frightening; permit me to apologise again—the esteemed
      lady, Mrs Clennam, in her invalid chamber above stairs.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Swagger and an air of authorised condescension do so much, that Mr
      Flintwinch had already begun to think this a highly gentlemanly personage.
      Not the less unyielding with him on that account, he scraped his chin and
      said, what could he have the honour of doing for Mr Blandois to-night, out
      of business hours?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Faith!’ returned that gentleman, shrugging his cloaked shoulders, ‘I must
      change, and eat and drink, and be lodged somewhere. Have the kindness to
      advise me, a total stranger, where, and money is a matter of perfect
      indifference until to-morrow. The nearer the place, the better. Next door,
      if that’s all.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch was slowly beginning, ‘For a gentleman of your habits, there
      is not in this immediate neighbourhood any hotel—’ when Mr Blandois
      took him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So much for my habits! my dear sir,’ snapping his fingers. ‘A citizen of
      the world has no habits. That I am, in my poor way, a gentleman, by
      Heaven! I will not deny, but I have no unaccommodating prejudiced habits.
      A clean room, a hot dish for dinner, and a bottle of not absolutely
      poisonous wine, are all I want tonight. But I want that much without the
      trouble of going one unnecessary inch to get it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There is,’ said Mr Flintwinch, with more than his usual deliberation, as
      he met, for a moment, Mr Blandois’ shining eyes, which were restless;
      ‘there is a coffee-house and tavern close here, which, so far, I can
      recommend; but there’s no style about it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I dispense with style!’ said Mr Blandois, waving his hand. ‘Do me the
      honour to show me the house, and introduce me there (if I am not too
      troublesome), and I shall be infinitely obliged.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, upon this, looked up his hat, and lighted Mr Blandois
      across the hall again. As he put the candle on a bracket, where the dark
      old panelling almost served as an extinguisher for it, he bethought
      himself of going up to tell the invalid that he would not be absent five
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oblige me,’ said the visitor, on his saying so, ‘by presenting my card of
      visit. Do me the favour to add that I shall be happy to wait on Mrs
      Clennam, to offer my personal compliments, and to apologise for having
      occasioned any agitation in this tranquil corner, if it should suit her
      convenience to endure the presence of a stranger for a few minutes, after
      he shall have changed his wet clothes and fortified himself with something
      to eat and drink.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah made all despatch, and said, on his return, ‘She’ll be glad to
      see you, sir; but, being conscious that her sick room has no attractions,
      wishes me to say that she won’t hold you to your offer, in case you should
      think better of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To think better of it,’ returned the gallant Blandois, ‘would be to
      slight a lady; to slight a lady would be to be deficient in chivalry
      towards the sex; and chivalry towards the sex is a part of my character!’ 
      Thus expressing himself, he threw the draggled skirt of his cloak over his
      shoulder, and accompanied Mr Flintwinch to the tavern; taking up on the
      road a porter who was waiting with his portmanteau on the outer side of
      the gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was kept in a homely manner, and the condescension of Mr
      Blandois was infinite. It seemed to fill to inconvenience the little bar
      in which the widow landlady and her two daughters received him; it was
      much too big for the narrow wainscoted room with a bagatelle-board in it,
      that was first proposed for his reception; it perfectly swamped the little
      private holiday sitting-room of the family, which was finally given up to
      him. Here, in dry clothes and scented linen, with sleeked hair, a great
      ring on each forefinger and a massive show of watch-chain, Mr Blandois
      waiting for his dinner, lolling on a window-seat with his knees drawn up,
      looked (for all the difference in the setting of the jewel) fearfully and
      wonderfully like a certain Monsieur Rigaud who had once so waited for his
      breakfast, lying on the stone ledge of the iron grating of a cell in a
      villainous dungeon at Marseilles.
    </p>
    <p>
      His greed at dinner, too, was closely in keeping with the greed of
      Monsieur Rigaud at breakfast. His avaricious manner of collecting all the
      eatables about him, and devouring some with his eyes while devouring
      others with his jaws, was the same manner. His utter disregard of other
      people, as shown in his way of tossing the little womanly toys of
      furniture about, flinging favourite cushions under his boots for a softer
      rest, and crushing delicate coverings with his big body and his great
      black head, had the same brute selfishness at the bottom of it. The softly
      moving hands that were so busy among the dishes had the old wicked
      facility of the hands that had clung to the bars. And when he could eat no
      more, and sat sucking his delicate fingers one by one and wiping them on a
      cloth, there wanted nothing but the substitution of vine-leaves to finish
      the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this man, with his moustache going up and his nose coming down in that
      most evil of smiles, and with his surface eyes looking as if they belonged
      to his dyed hair, and had had their natural power of reflecting light
      stopped by some similar process, Nature, always true, and never working in
      vain, had set the mark, Beware! It was not her fault, if the warning were
      fruitless. She is never to blame in any such instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois, having finished his repast and cleaned his fingers, took a
      cigar from his pocket, and, lying on the window-seat again, smoked it out
      at his leisure, occasionally apostrophising the smoke as it parted from
      his thin lips in a thin stream:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Blandois, you shall turn the tables on society, my little child. Haha!
      Holy blue, you have begun well, Blandois! At a pinch, an excellent master
      in English or French; a man for the bosom of families! You have a quick
      perception, you have humour, you have ease, you have insinuating manners,
      you have a good appearance; in effect, you are a gentleman! A gentleman
      you shall live, my small boy, and a gentleman you shall die. You shall
      win, however the game goes. They shall all confess your merit, Blandois.
      You shall subdue the society which has grievously wronged you, to your own
      high spirit. Death of my soul! You are high spirited by right and by
      nature, my Blandois!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To such soothing murmurs did this gentleman smoke out his cigar and drink
      out his bottle of wine. Both being finished, he shook himself into a
      sitting attitude; and with the concluding serious apostrophe, ‘Hold, then!
      Blandois, you ingenious one, have all your wits about you!’ arose and went
      back to the house of Clennam and Co.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was received at the door by Mistress Affery, who, under instructions
      from her lord, had lighted up two candles in the hall and a third on the
      staircase, and who conducted him to Mrs Clennam’s room. Tea was prepared
      there, and such little company arrangements had been made as usually
      attended the reception of expected visitors. They were slight on the
      greatest occasion, never extending beyond the production of the China
      tea-service, and the covering of the bed with a sober and sad drapery. For
      the rest, there was the bier-like sofa with the block upon it, and the
      figure in the widow’s dress, as if attired for execution; the fire topped
      by the mound of damped ashes; the grate with its second little mound of
      ashes; the kettle and the smell of black dye; all as they had been for
      fifteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch presented the gentleman commended to the consideration of
      Clennam and Co. Mrs Clennam, who had the letter lying before her, bent her
      head and requested him to sit. They looked very closely at one another.
      That was but natural curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thank you, sir, for thinking of a disabled woman like me. Few who come
      here on business have any remembrance to bestow on one so removed from
      observation. It would be idle to expect that they should have. Out of
      sight, out of mind. While I am grateful for the exception, I don’t
      complain of the rule.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois, in his most gentlemanly manner, was afraid he had disturbed
      her by unhappily presenting himself at such an unconscionable time. For
      which he had already offered his best apologies to Mr—he begged
      pardon—but by name had not the distinguished honour—
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Flintwinch has been connected with the House many years.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois was Mr Flintwinch’s most obedient humble servant. He entreated
      Mr Flintwinch to receive the assurance of his profoundest consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My husband being dead,’ said Mrs Clennam, ‘and my son preferring another
      pursuit, our old House has no other representative in these days than Mr
      Flintwinch.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What do you call yourself?’ was the surly demand of that gentleman. ‘You
      have the head of two men.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My sex disqualifies me,’ she proceeded with merely a slight turn of her
      eyes in Jeremiah’s direction, ‘from taking a responsible part in the
      business, even if I had the ability; and therefore Mr Flintwinch combines
      my interest with his own, and conducts it. It is not what it used to be;
      but some of our old friends (principally the writers of this letter) have
      the kindness not to forget us, and we retain the power of doing what they
      entrust to us as efficiently as we ever did. This however is not
      interesting to you. You are English, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Faith, madam, no; I am neither born nor bred in England. In effect, I am
      of no country,’ said Mr Blandois, stretching out his leg and smiting it:
      ‘I descend from half-a-dozen countries.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have been much about the world?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is true. By Heaven, madam, I have been here and there and everywhere!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have no ties, probably. Are not married?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Madam,’ said Mr Blandois, with an ugly fall of his eyebrows, ‘I adore
      your sex, but I am not married—never was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery, who stood at the table near him, pouring out the tea,
      happened in her dreamy state to look at him as he said these words, and to
      fancy that she caught an expression in his eyes which attracted her own
      eyes so that she could not get them away. The effect of this fancy was to
      keep her staring at him with the tea-pot in her hand, not only to her own
      great uneasiness, but manifestly to his, too; and, through them both, to
      Mrs Clennam’s and Mr Flintwinch’s. Thus a few ghostly moments supervened,
      when they were all confusedly staring without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Affery,’ her mistress was the first to say, ‘what is the matter with
      you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t know,’ said Mistress Affery, with her disengaged left hand
      extended towards the visitor. ‘It ain’t me. It’s him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What does this good woman mean?’ cried Mr Blandois, turning white, hot,
      and slowly rising with a look of such deadly wrath that it contrasted
      surprisingly with the slight force of his words. ‘How is it possible to
      understand this good creature?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s <i>not</i> possible,’ said Mr Flintwinch, screwing himself rapidly
      in that direction. ‘She don’t know what she means. She’s an idiot, a
      wanderer in her mind. She shall have a dose, she shall have such a dose!
      Get along with you, my woman,’ he added in her ear, ‘get along with you,
      while you know you’re Affery, and before you’re shaken to yeast.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Affery, sensible of the danger in which her identity stood,
      relinquished the tea-pot as her husband seized it, put her apron over her
      head, and in a twinkling vanished. The visitor gradually broke into a
      smile, and sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You’ll excuse her, Mr Blandois,’ said Jeremiah, pouring out the tea
      himself, ‘she’s failing and breaking up; that’s what she’s about. Do you
      take sugar, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, no tea for me.—Pardon my observing it, but that’s a very
      remarkable watch!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea-table was drawn up near the sofa, with a small interval between it
      and Mrs Clennam’s own particular table. Mr Blandois in his gallantry had
      risen to hand that lady her tea (her dish of toast was already there), and
      it was in placing the cup conveniently within her reach that the watch,
      lying before her as it always did, attracted his attention. Mrs Clennam
      looked suddenly up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I be permitted? Thank you. A fine old-fashioned watch,’ he said,
      taking it in his hand. ‘Heavy for use, but massive and genuine. I have a
      partiality for everything genuine. Such as I am, I am genuine myself. Hah!
      A gentleman’s watch with two cases in the old fashion. May I remove it
      from the outer case? Thank you. Aye? An old silk watch-lining, worked with
      beads! I have often seen these among old Dutch people and Belgians. Quaint
      things!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They are old-fashioned, too,’ said Mrs Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very. But this is not so old as the watch, I think?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think not.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Extraordinary how they used to complicate these cyphers!’ remarked Mr
      Blandois, glancing up with his own smile again. ‘Now is this D. N. F.? It
      might be almost anything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Those are the letters.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, who had been observantly pausing all this time with a cup
      of tea in his hand, and his mouth open ready to swallow the contents,
      began to do so: always entirely filling his mouth before he emptied it at
      a gulp; and always deliberating again before he refilled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘D. N. F. was some tender, lovely, fascinating fair-creature, I make no
      doubt,’ observed Mr Blandois, as he snapped on the case again. ‘I adore
      her memory on the assumption. Unfortunately for my peace of mind, I adore
      but too readily. It may be a vice, it may be a virtue, but adoration of
      female beauty and merit constitutes three parts of my character, madam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch had by this time poured himself out another cup of tea,
      which he was swallowing in gulps as before, with his eyes directed to the
      invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You may be heart-free here, sir,’ she returned to Mr Blandois. ‘Those
      letters are not intended, I believe, for the initials of any name.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of a motto, perhaps,’ said Mr Blandois, casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of a sentence. They have always stood, I believe, for Do Not Forget!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And naturally,’ said Mr Blandois, replacing the watch and stepping
      backward to his former chair, ‘you do <i>not</i> forget.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, finishing his tea, not only took a longer gulp than he had
      taken yet, but made his succeeding pause under new circumstances: that is
      to say, with his head thrown back and his cup held still at his lips,
      while his eyes were still directed at the invalid. She had that force of
      face, and that concentrated air of collecting her firmness or obstinacy,
      which represented in her case what would have been gesture and action in
      another, as she replied with her deliberate strength of speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, I do not forget. To lead a life as monotonous as mine has been
      during many years, is not the way to forget. To lead a life of
      self-correction is not the way to forget. To be sensible of having (as we
      all have, every one of us, all the children of Adam!) offences to expiate
      and peace to make, does not justify the desire to forget. Therefore I have
      long dismissed it, and I neither forget nor wish to forget.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, who had latterly been shaking the sediment at the bottom of
      his tea-cup, round and round, here gulped it down, and putting the cup in
      the tea-tray, as done with, turned his eyes upon Mr Blandois as if to ask
      him what he thought of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All expressed, madam,’ said Mr Blandois, with his smoothest bow and his
      white hand on his breast, ‘by the word “naturally,” which I am proud to
      have had sufficient apprehension and appreciation (but without
      appreciation I could not be Blandois) to employ.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pardon me, sir,’ she returned, ‘if I doubt the likelihood of a gentleman
      of pleasure, and change, and politeness, accustomed to court and to be
      courted—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh madam! By Heaven!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—If I doubt the likelihood of such a character quite comprehending
      what belongs to mine in my circumstances. Not to obtrude doctrine upon
      you,’ she looked at the rigid pile of hard pale books before her, ‘(for
      you go your own way, and the consequences are on your own head), I will
      say this much: that I shape my course by pilots, strictly by proved and
      tried pilots, under whom I cannot be shipwrecked—can not be—and
      that if I were unmindful of the admonition conveyed in those three
      letters, I should not be half as chastened as I am.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious how she seized the occasion to argue with some invisible
      opponent. Perhaps with her own better sense, always turning upon herself
      and her own deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If I forgot my ignorances in my life of health and freedom, I might
      complain of the life to which I am now condemned. I never do; I never have
      done. If I forgot that this scene, the Earth, is expressly meant to be a
      scene of gloom, and hardship, and dark trial, for the creatures who are
      made out of its dust, I might have some tenderness for its vanities. But I
      have no such tenderness. If I did not know that we are, every one, the
      subject (most justly the subject) of a wrath that must be satisfied, and
      against which mere actions are nothing, I might repine at the difference
      between me, imprisoned here, and the people who pass that gateway yonder.
      But I take it as a grace and favour to be elected to make the satisfaction
      I am making here, to know what I know for certain here, and to work out
      what I have worked out here. My affliction might otherwise have had no
      meaning to me. Hence I would forget, and I do forget, nothing. Hence I am
      contented, and say it is better with me than with millions.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke these words, she put her hand upon the watch, and restored it
      to the precise spot on her little table which it always occupied. With her
      touch lingering upon it, she sat for some moments afterwards, looking at
      it steadily and half-defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois, during this exposition, had been strictly attentive, keeping
      his eyes fastened on the lady, and thoughtfully stroking his moustache
      with his two hands. Mr Flintwinch had been a little fidgety, and now
      struck in.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, there, there!’ said he. ‘That is quite understood, Mrs Clennam,
      and you have spoken piously and well. Mr Blandois, I suspect, is not of a
      pious cast.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘On the contrary, sir!’ that gentleman protested, snapping his fingers.
      ‘Your pardon! It’s a part of my character. I am sensitive, ardent,
      conscientious, and imaginative. A sensitive, ardent, conscientious, and
      imaginative man, Mr Flintwinch, must be that, or nothing!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an inkling of suspicion in Mr Flintwinch’s face that he might be
      nothing, as he swaggered out of his chair (it was characteristic of this
      man, as it is of all men similarly marked, that whatever he did, he
      overdid, though it were sometimes by only a hairsbreadth), and approached
      to take his leave of Mrs Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘With what will appear to you the egotism of a sick old woman, sir,’ she
      then said, ‘though really through your accidental allusion, I have been
      led away into the subject of myself and my infirmities. Being so
      considerate as to visit me, I hope you will be likewise so considerate as
      to overlook that. Don’t compliment me, if you please.’ For he was
      evidently going to do it. ‘Mr Flintwinch will be happy to render you any
      service, and I hope your stay in this city may prove agreeable.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois thanked her, and kissed his hand several times. ‘This is an
      old room,’ he remarked, with a sudden sprightliness of manner, looking
      round when he got near the door, ‘I have been so interested that I have
      not observed it. But it’s a genuine old room.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is a genuine old house,’ said Mrs Clennam, with her frozen smile. ‘A
      place of no pretensions, but a piece of antiquity.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Faith!’ cried the visitor. ‘If Mr Flintwinch would do me the favour to
      take me through the rooms on my way out, he could hardly oblige me more.
      An old house is a weakness with me. I have many weaknesses, but none
      greater. I love and study the picturesque in all its varieties. I have
      been called picturesque myself. It is no merit to be picturesque—I
      have greater merits, perhaps—but I may be, by an accident. Sympathy,
      sympathy!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I tell you beforehand, Mr Blandois, that you’ll find it very dingy and
      very bare,’ said Jeremiah, taking up the candle. ‘It’s not worth your
      looking at.‘But Mr Blandois, smiting him in a friendly manner on the back,
      only laughed; so the said Blandois kissed his hand again to Mrs Clennam,
      and they went out of the room together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t care to go up-stairs?’ said Jeremiah, on the landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘On the contrary, Mr Flintwinch; if not tiresome to you, I shall be
      ravished!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, therefore, wormed himself up the staircase, and Mr Blandois
      followed close. They ascended to the great garret bed-room which Arthur
      had occupied on the night of his return. ‘There, Mr Blandois!’ said
      Jeremiah, showing it, ‘I hope you may think that worth coming so high to
      see. I confess I don’t.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois being enraptured, they walked through other garrets and
      passages, and came down the staircase again. By this time Mr Flintwinch
      had remarked that he never found the visitor looking at any room, after
      throwing one quick glance around, but always found the visitor looking at
      him, Mr Flintwinch. With this discovery in his thoughts, he turned about
      on the staircase for another experiment. He met his eyes directly; and on
      the instant of their fixing one another, the visitor, with that ugly play
      of nose and moustache, laughed (as he had done at every similar moment
      since they left Mrs Clennam’s chamber) a diabolically silent laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a much shorter man than the visitor, Mr Flintwinch was at the physical
      disadvantage of being thus disagreeably leered at from a height; and as he
      went first down the staircase, and was usually a step or two lower than
      the other, this disadvantage was at the time increased. He postponed
      looking at Mr Blandois again until this accidental inequality was removed
      by their having entered the late Mr Clennam’s room. But, then twisting
      himself suddenly round upon him, he found his look unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A most admirable old house,’ smiled Mr Blandois. ‘So mysterious. Do you
      never hear any haunted noises here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Noises,’ returned Mr Flintwinch. ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nor see any devils?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not,’ said Mr Flintwinch, grimly screwing himself at his questioner, ‘not
      any that introduce themselves under that name and in that capacity.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Haha! A portrait here, I see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (Still looking at Mr Flintwinch, as if he were the portrait.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s a portrait, sir, as you observe.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘May I ask the subject, Mr Flintwinch?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, deceased. Her husband.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Former owner of the remarkable watch, perhaps?’ said the visitor.

    <p>
      Mr Flintwinch, who had cast his eyes towards the portrait, twisted himself
      about again, and again found himself the subject of the same look and
      smile. ‘Yes, Mr Blandois,’ he replied tartly. ‘It was his, and his uncle’s
      before him, and Lord knows who before him; and that’s all I can tell you
      of its pedigree.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s a strongly marked character, Mr Flintwinch, our friend up-stairs.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, sir,’ said Jeremiah, twisting himself at the visitor again, as he
      did during the whole of this dialogue, like some screw-machine that fell
      short of its grip; for the other never changed, and he always felt obliged
      to retreat a little. ‘She is a remarkable woman. Great fortitude—great
      strength of mind.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘They must have been very happy,’ said Blandois.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Who?’ demanded Mr Flintwinch, with another screw at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois shook his right forefinger towards the sick room, and his left
      forefinger towards the portrait, and then, putting his arms akimbo and
      striding his legs wide apart, stood smiling down at Mr Flintwinch with the
      advancing nose and the retreating moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As happy as most other married people, I suppose,’ returned Mr
      Flintwinch. ‘I can’t say. I don’t know. There are secrets in all
      families.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Secrets!’ cried Mr Blandois, quickly. ‘Say it again, my son.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say,’ replied Mr Flintwinch, upon whom he had swelled himself so
      suddenly that Mr Flintwinch found his face almost brushed by the dilated
      chest. ‘I say there are secrets in all families.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So there are,’ cried the other, clapping him on both shoulders, and
      rolling him backwards and forwards. ‘Haha! you are right. So there are!
      Secrets! Holy Blue! There are the devil’s own secrets in some families, Mr
      Flintwinch!’ With that, after clapping Mr Flintwinch on both shoulders
      several times, as if in a friendly and humorous way he were rallying him
      on a joke he had made, he threw up his arms, threw back his head, hooked
      his hands together behind it, and burst into a roar of laughter. It was in
      vain for Mr Flintwinch to try another screw at him. He had his laugh out.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, favour me with the candle a moment,’ he said, when he had done. ‘Let
      us have a look at the husband of the remarkable lady. Hah!’ holding up the
      light at arm’s length. ‘A decided expression of face here too, though not
      of the same character. Looks as if he were saying, what is it—Do Not
      Forget—does he not, Mr Flintwinch? By Heaven, sir, he does!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he returned the candle, he looked at him once more; and then, leisurely
      strolling out with him into the hall, declared it to be a charming old
      house indeed, and one which had so greatly pleased him that he would not
      have missed inspecting it for a hundred pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout these singular freedoms on the part of Mr Blandois, which
      involved a general alteration in his demeanour, making it much coarser and
      rougher, much more violent and audacious than before, Mr Flintwinch, whose
      leathern face was not liable to many changes, preserved its immobility
      intact. Beyond now appearing perhaps, to have been left hanging a trifle
      too long before that friendly operation of cutting down, he outwardly
      maintained an equable composure. They had brought their survey to a close
      in the little room at the side of the hall, and he stood there, eyeing Mr
      Blandois.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am glad you are so well satisfied, sir,’ was his calm remark. ‘I didn’t
      expect it. You seem to be quite in good spirits.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In admirable spirits,’ returned Blandois. ‘Word of honour! never more
      refreshed in spirits. Do you ever have presentiments, Mr Flintwinch?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am not sure that I know what you mean by the term, sir,’ replied that
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Say, in this case, Mr Flintwinch, undefined anticipations of pleasure to
      come.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I can’t say I’m sensible of such a sensation at present,’ returned Mr
      Flintwinch with the utmost gravity. ‘If I should find it coming on, I’ll
      mention it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now I,’ said Blandois, ‘I, my son, have a presentiment to-night that we
      shall be well acquainted. Do you find it coming on?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘N-no,’ returned Mr Flintwinch, deliberately inquiring of himself. ‘I
      can’t say I do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have a strong presentiment that we shall become intimately acquainted.—You
      have no feeling of that sort yet?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not yet,’ said Mr Flintwinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Blandois, taking him by both shoulders again, rolled him about a little
      in his former merry way, then drew his arm through his own, and invited
      him to come off and drink a bottle of wine like a dear deep old dog as he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment’s indecision, Mr Flintwinch accepted the invitation, and
      they went out to the quarters where the traveller was lodged, through a
      heavy rain which had rattled on the windows, roofs, and pavements, ever
      since nightfall. The thunder and lightning had long ago passed over, but
      the rain was furious. On their arrival at Mr Blandois’ room, a bottle of
      port wine was ordered by that gallant gentleman; who (crushing every
      pretty thing he could collect, in the soft disposition of his dainty
      figure) coiled himself upon the window-seat, while Mr Flintwinch took a
      chair opposite to him, with the table between them. Mr Blandois proposed
      having the largest glasses in the house, to which Mr Flintwinch assented.
      The bumpers filled, Mr Blandois, with a roystering gaiety, clinked the top
      of his glass against the bottom of Mr Flintwinch’s, and the bottom of his
      glass against the top of Mr Flintwinch’s, and drank to the intimate
      acquaintance he foresaw. Mr Flintwinch gravely pledged him, and drank all
      the wine he could get, and said nothing. As often as Mr Blandois clinked
      glasses (which was at every replenishment), Mr Flintwinch stolidly did his
      part of the clinking, and would have stolidly done his companion’s part of
      the wine as well as his own: being, except in the article of palate, a
      mere cask.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, Mr Blandois found that to pour port wine into the reticent
      Flintwinch was, not to open him but to shut him up. Moreover, he had the
      appearance of a perfect ability to go on all night; or, if occasion were,
      all next day and all next night; whereas Mr Blandois soon grew
      indistinctly conscious of swaggering too fiercely and boastfully. He
      therefore terminated the entertainment at the end of the third bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You will draw upon us to-morrow, sir,’ said Mr Flintwinch, with a
      business-like face at parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My Cabbage,’ returned the other, taking him by the collar with both
      hands, ‘I’ll draw upon you; have no fear. Adieu, my Flintwinch. Receive at
      parting;’ here he gave him a southern embrace, and kissed him soundly on
      both cheeks; ‘the word of a gentleman! By a thousand Thunders, you shall
      see me again!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not present himself next day, though the letter of advice came duly
      to hand. Inquiring after him at night, Mr Flintwinch found, with surprise,
      that he had paid his bill and gone back to the Continent by way of Calais.
      Nevertheless, Jeremiah scraped out of his cogitating face a lively
      conviction that Mr Blandois would keep his word on this occasion, and
      would be seen again.

	</hgroup>
<p>Anybody may pass, any day, in the thronged thoroughfares of the
      metropolis, some meagre, wrinkled, yellow old man (who might be supposed
      to have dropped from the stars, if there were any star in the Heavens dull
      enough to be suspected of casting off so feeble a spark), creeping along
      with a scared air, as though bewildered and a little frightened by the
      noise and bustle. This old man is always a little old man. If he were ever
      a big old man, he has shrunk into a little old man; if he were always a
      little old man, he has dwindled into a less old man. His coat is a colour,
      and cut, that never was the mode anywhere, at any period. Clearly, it was
      not made for him, or for any individual mortal. Some wholesale contractor
      measured Fate for five thousand coats of such quality, and Fate has lent
      this old coat to this old man, as one of a long unfinished line of many
      old men. It has always large dull metal buttons, similar to no other
      buttons. This old man wears a hat, a thumbed and napless and yet an
      obdurate hat, which has never adapted itself to the shape of his poor
      head. His coarse shirt and his coarse neckcloth have no more individuality
      than his coat and hat; they have the same character of not being his—of
      not being anybody’s. Yet this old man wears these clothes with a certain
      unaccustomed air of being dressed and elaborated for the public ways; as
      though he passed the greater part of his time in a nightcap and gown. And
      so, like the country mouse in the second year of a famine, come to see the
      town mouse, and timidly threading his way to the town-mouse’s lodging
      through a city of cats, this old man passes in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes, on holidays towards evening, he will be seen to walk with a
      slightly increased infirmity, and his old eyes will glimmer with a moist
      and marshy light. Then the little old man is drunk. A very small measure
      will overset him; he may be bowled off his unsteady legs with a half-pint
      pot. Some pitying acquaintance—chance acquaintance very often—has
      warmed up his weakness with a treat of beer, and the consequence will be
      the lapse of a longer time than usual before he shall pass again. For the
      little old man is going home to the Workhouse; and on his good behaviour
      they do not let him out often (though methinks they might, considering the
      few years he has before him to go out in, under the sun); and on his bad
      behaviour they shut him up closer than ever in a grove of two score and
      nineteen more old men, every one of whom smells of all the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Plornish’s father,—a poor little reedy piping old gentleman,
      like a worn-out bird; who had been in what he called the music-binding
      business, and met with great misfortunes, and who had seldom been able to
      make his way, or to see it or to pay it, or to do anything at all with it
      but find it no thoroughfare,—had retired of his own accord to the
      Workhouse which was appointed by law to be the Good Samaritan of his
      district (without the twopence, which was bad political economy), on the
      settlement of that execution which had carried Mr Plornish to the
      Marshalsea College. Previous to his son-in-law’s difficulties coming to
      that head, Old Nandy (he was always so called in his legal Retreat, but he
      was Old Mr Nandy among the Bleeding Hearts) had sat in a corner of the
      Plornish fireside, and taken his bite and sup out of the Plornish
      cupboard. He still hoped to resume that domestic position when Fortune
      should smile upon his son-in-law; in the meantime, while she preserved an
      immovable countenance, he was, and resolved to remain, one of these little
      old men in a grove of little old men with a community of flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no poverty in him, and no coat on him that never was the mode, and no
      Old Men’s Ward for his dwelling-place, could quench his daughter’s
      admiration. Mrs Plornish was as proud of her father’s talents as she could
      possibly have been if they had made him Lord Chancellor. She had as firm a
      belief in the sweetness and propriety of his manners as she could possibly
      have had if he had been Lord Chamberlain. The poor little old man knew
      some pale and vapid little songs, long out of date, about Chloe, and
      Phyllis, and Strephon being wounded by the son of Venus; and for Mrs
      Plornish there was no such music at the Opera as the small internal
      flutterings and chirpings wherein he would discharge himself of these
      ditties, like a weak, little, broken barrel-organ, ground by a baby. On
      his ‘days out,’ those flecks of light in his flat vista of pollard old
      men,’ it was at once Mrs Plornish’s delight and sorrow, when he was strong
      with meat, and had taken his full halfpenny-worth of porter, to say, ‘Sing
      us a song, Father.’ Then he would give them Chloe, and if he were in
      pretty good spirits, Phyllis also—Strephon he had hardly been up to
      since he went into retirement—and then would Mrs Plornish declare
      she did believe there never was such a singer as Father, and wipe her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had come from Court on these occasions, nay, if he had been the
      noble Refrigerator come home triumphantly from a foreign court to be
      presented and promoted on his last tremendous failure, Mrs Plornish could
      not have handed him with greater elevation about Bleeding Heart Yard.
      ‘Here’s Father,’ she would say, presenting him to a neighbour. ‘Father
      will soon be home with us for good, now. Ain’t Father looking well?
      Father’s a sweeter singer than ever; you’d never have forgotten it, if
      you’d aheard him just now.’ As to Mr Plornish, he had married these
      articles of belief in marrying Mr Nandy’s daughter, and only wondered how
      it was that so gifted an old gentleman had not made a fortune. This he
      attributed, after much reflection, to his musical genius not having been
      scientifically developed in his youth. ‘For why,’ argued Mr Plornish, ‘why
      go a-binding music when you’ve got it in yourself? That’s where it is, I
      consider.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Nandy had a patron: one patron. He had a patron who in a certain
      sumptuous way—an apologetic way, as if he constantly took an
      admiring audience to witness that he really could not help being more free
      with this old fellow than they might have expected, on account of his
      simplicity and poverty—was mightily good to him. Old Nandy had been
      several times to the Marshalsea College, communicating with his son-in-law
      during his short durance there; and had happily acquired to himself, and
      had by degrees and in course of time much improved, the patronage of the
      Father of that national institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Dorrit was in the habit of receiving this old man as if the old man
      held of him in vassalage under some feudal tenure. He made little treats
      and teas for him, as if he came in with his homage from some outlying
      district where the tenantry were in a primitive state. It seemed as if
      there were moments when he could by no means have sworn but that the old
      man was an ancient retainer of his, who had been meritoriously faithful.
      When he mentioned him, he spoke of him casually as his old pensioner. He
      had a wonderful satisfaction in seeing him, and in commenting on his
      decayed condition after he was gone. It appeared to him amazing that he
      could hold up his head at all, poor creature. ‘In the Workhouse, sir, the
      Union; no privacy, no visitors, no station, no respect, no speciality.
      Most deplorable!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Old Nandy’s birthday, and they let him out. He said nothing about
      its being his birthday, or they might have kept him in; for such old men
      should not be born. He passed along the streets as usual to Bleeding Heart
      Yard, and had his dinner with his daughter and son-in-law, and gave them
      Phyllis. He had hardly concluded, when Little Dorrit looked in to see how
      they all were.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Miss Dorrit,’ said Mrs Plornish, ‘here’s Father! Ain’t he looking nice?
      And such voice he’s in!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit gave him her hand, and smilingly said she had not seen him
      this long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, they’re rather hard on poor Father,’ said Mrs Plornish with a
      lengthening face, ‘and don’t let him have half as much change and fresh
      air as would benefit him. But he’ll soon be home for good, now. Won’t you,
      Father?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, my dear, I hope so. In good time, please God.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Mr Plornish delivered himself of an oration which he invariably made,
      word for word the same, on all such opportunities. It was couched in the
      following terms:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘John Edward Nandy. Sir. While there’s a ounce of wittles or drink of any
      sort in this present roof, you’re fully welcome to your share on it. While
      there’s a handful of fire or a mouthful of bed in this present roof,
      you’re fully welcome to your share on it. If so be as there should be
      nothing in this present roof, you should be as welcome to your share on it
      as if it was something, much or little. And this is what I mean and so I
      don’t deceive you, and consequently which is to stand out is to entreat of
      you, and therefore why not do it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this lucid address, which Mr Plornish always delivered as if he had
      composed it (as no doubt he had) with enormous labour, Mrs Plornish’s
      father pipingly replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I thank you kindly, Thomas, and I know your intentions well, which is the
      same I thank you kindly for. But no, Thomas. Until such times as it’s not
      to take it out of your children’s mouths, which take it is, and call it by
      what name you will it do remain and equally deprive, though may they come,
      and too soon they can not come, no Thomas, no!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Plornish, who had been turning her face a little away with a corner of
      her apron in her hand, brought herself back to the conversation again by
      telling Miss Dorrit that Father was going over the water to pay his
      respects, unless she knew of any reason why it might not be agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her answer was, ‘I am going straight home, and if he will come with me I
      shall be so glad to take care of him—so glad,’ said Little Dorrit,
      always thoughtful of the feelings of the weak, ‘of his company.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, Father!’ cried Mrs Plornish. ‘Ain’t you a gay young man to be
      going for a walk along with Miss Dorrit! Let me tie your neck-handkerchief
      into a regular good bow, for you’re a regular beau yourself, Father, if
      ever there was one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this filial joke his daughter smartened him up, and gave him a loving
      hug, and stood at the door with her weak child in her arms, and her strong
      child tumbling down the steps, looking after her little old father as he
      toddled away with his arm under Little Dorrit’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked at a slow pace, and Little Dorrit took him by the Iron Bridge
      and sat him down there for a rest, and they looked over at the water and
      talked about the shipping, and the old man mentioned what he would do if
      he had a ship full of gold coming home to him (his plan was to take a
      noble lodging for the Plornishes and himself at a Tea Gardens, and live
      there all the rest of their lives, attended on by the waiter), and it was
      a special birthday of the old man. They were within five minutes of their
      destination, when, at the corner of her own street, they came upon Fanny
      in her new bonnet bound for the same port.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, good gracious me, Amy!’ cried that young lady starting. ‘You never
      mean it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mean what, Fanny dear?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well! I could have believed a great deal of you,’ returned the young lady
      with burning indignation, ‘but I don’t think even I could have believed
      this, of even you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fanny!’ cried Little Dorrit, wounded and astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! Don’t Fanny me, you mean little thing, don’t! The idea of coming
      along the open streets, in the broad light of day, with a Pauper!’ (firing
      off the last word as if it were a ball from an air-gun).
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O Fanny!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I tell you not to Fanny me, for I’ll not submit to it! I never knew such
      a thing. The way in which you are resolved and determined to disgrace us
      on all occasions, is really infamous. You bad little thing!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does it disgrace anybody,’ said Little Dorrit, very gently, ‘to take care
      of this poor old man?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, miss,’ returned her sister, ‘and you ought to know it does. And you
      do know it does, and you do it because you know it does. The principal
      pleasure of your life is to remind your family of their misfortunes. And
      the next great pleasure of your existence is to keep low company. But,
      however, if you have no sense of decency, I have. You’ll please to allow
      me to go on the other side of the way, unmolested.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, she bounced across to the opposite pavement. The old disgrace,
      who had been deferentially bowing a pace or two off (for Little Dorrit had
      let his arm go in her wonder, when Fanny began), and who had been hustled
      and cursed by impatient passengers for stopping the way, rejoined his
      companion, rather giddy, and said, ‘I hope nothing’s wrong with your
      honoured father, Miss? I hope there’s nothing the matter in the honoured
      family?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, no,’ returned Little Dorrit. ‘No, thank you. Give me your arm again,
      Mr Nandy. We shall soon be there now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So she talked to him as she had talked before, and they came to the Lodge
      and found Mr Chivery on the lock, and went in. Now, it happened that the
      Father of the Marshalsea was sauntering towards the Lodge at the moment
      when they were coming out of it, entering the prison arm in arm. As the
      spectacle of their approach met his view, he displayed the utmost
      agitation and despondency of mind; and—altogether regardless of Old
      Nandy, who, making his reverence, stood with his hat in his hand, as he
      always did in that gracious presence—turned about, and hurried in at
      his own doorway and up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the old unfortunate, whom in an evil hour she had taken under her
      protection, with a hurried promise to return to him directly, Little
      Dorrit hastened after her father, and, on the staircase, found Fanny
      following her, and flouncing up with offended dignity. The three came into
      the room almost together; and the Father sat down in his chair, buried his
      face in his hands, and uttered a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course,’ said Fanny. ‘Very proper. Poor, afflicted Pa! Now, I hope you
      believe me, Miss?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it, father?’ cried Little Dorrit, bending over him. ‘Have I made
      you unhappy, father? Not I, I hope!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You hope, indeed! I dare say! Oh, you’—Fanny paused for a
      sufficiently strong expression—‘you Common-minded little Amy! You
      complete prison-child!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped these angry reproaches with a wave of his hand, and sobbed out,
      raising his face and shaking his melancholy head at his younger daughter,
      ‘Amy, I know that you are innocent in intention. But you have cut me to
      the soul.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Innocent in intention!’ the implacable Fanny struck in. ‘Stuff in
      intention! Low in intention! Lowering of the family in intention!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father!’ cried Little Dorrit, pale and trembling. ‘I am very sorry. Pray
      forgive me. Tell me how it is, that I may not do it again!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How it is, you prevaricating little piece of goods!’ cried Fanny. ‘You
      know how it is. I have told you already, so don’t fly in the face of
      Providence by attempting to deny it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush! Amy,’ said the father, passing his pocket-handkerchief several
      times across his face, and then grasping it convulsively in the hand that
      dropped across his knee, ‘I have done what I could to keep you select
      here; I have done what I could to retain you a position here. I may have
      succeeded; I may not. You may know it; you may not. I give no opinion. I
      have endured everything here but humiliation. That I have happily been
      spared—until this day.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here his convulsive grasp unclosed itself, and he put his
      pocket-handkerchief to his eyes again. Little Dorrit, on the ground beside
      him, with her imploring hand upon his arm, watched him remorsefully.
      Coming out of his fit of grief, he clenched his pocket-handkerchief once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Humiliation I have happily been spared until this day. Through all my
      troubles there has been that—Spirit in myself, and that—that
      submission to it, if I may use the term, in those about me, which has
      spared me—ha—humiliation. But this day, this minute, I have
      keenly felt it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course! How could it be otherwise?’ exclaimed the irrepressible Fanny.
      ‘Careering and prancing about with a Pauper!’ (air-gun again).
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, dear father,’ cried Little Dorrit, ‘I don’t justify myself for
      having wounded your dear heart—no! Heaven knows I don’t!’ She
      clasped her hands in quite an agony of distress. ‘I do nothing but beg and
      pray you to be comforted and overlook it. But if I had not known that you
      were kind to the old man yourself, and took much notice of him, and were
      always glad to see him, I would not have come here with him, father, I
      would not, indeed. What I have been so unhappy as to do, I have done in
      mistake. I would not wilfully bring a tear to your eyes, dear love!’ said
      Little Dorrit, her heart well-nigh broken, ‘for anything the world could
      give me, or anything it could take away.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fanny, with a partly angry and partly repentant sob, began to cry herself,
      and to say—as this young lady always said when she was half in
      passion and half out of it, half spiteful with herself and half spiteful
      with everybody else—that she wished she were dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea in the meantime took his younger daughter to
      his breast, and patted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, there! Say no more, Amy, say no more, my child. I will forget it
      as soon as I can. I,’ with hysterical cheerfulness, ‘I—shall soon be
      able to dismiss it. It is perfectly true, my dear, that I am always glad
      to see my old pensioner—as such, as such—and that I do—ha—extend
      as much protection and kindness to the—hum—the bruised reed—I
      trust I may so call him without impropriety—as in my circumstances,
      I can. It is quite true that this is the case, my dear child. At the same
      time, I preserve in doing this, if I may—ha—if I may use the
      expression—Spirit. Becoming Spirit. And there are some things which
      are,’ he stopped to sob, ‘irreconcilable with that, and wound that—wound
      it deeply. It is not that I have seen my good Amy attentive, and—ha—condescending
      to my old pensioner—it is not <i>that</i> that hurts me. It is, if I
      am to close the painful subject by being explicit, that I have seen my
      child, my own child, my own daughter, coming into this College out of the
      public streets—smiling! smiling!—arm in arm with—O my
      God, a livery!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This reference to the coat of no cut and no time, the unfortunate
      gentleman gasped forth, in a scarcely audible voice, and with his clenched
      pocket-handkerchief raised in the air. His excited feelings might have
      found some further painful utterance, but for a knock at the door, which
      had been already twice repeated, and to which Fanny (still wishing herself
      dead, and indeed now going so far as to add, buried) cried ‘Come in!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Ah, Young John!’ said the Father, in an altered and calmed voice. ‘What
      is it, Young John?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A letter for you, sir, being left in the Lodge just this minute, and a
      message with it, I thought, happening to be there myself, sir, I would
      bring it to your room.’ The speaker’s attention was much distracted by the
      piteous spectacle of Little Dorrit at her father’s feet, with her head
      turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed, John? Thank you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The letter is from Mr Clennam, sir—it’s the answer—and the
      message was, sir, that Mr Clennam also sent his compliments, and word that
      he would do himself the pleasure of calling this afternoon, hoping to see
      you, and likewise,’ attention more distracted than before, ‘Miss Amy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh!’ As the Father glanced into the letter (there was a bank-note in it),
      he reddened a little, and patted Amy on the head afresh. ‘Thank you, Young
      John. Quite right. Much obliged to you for your attention. No one
      waiting?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir, no one waiting.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, John. How is your mother, Young John?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir, she’s not quite as well as we could wish—in fact,
      we none of us are, except father—but she’s pretty well, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Say we sent our remembrances, will you? Say kind remembrances, if you
      please, Young John.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir, I will.’ And Mr Chivery junior went his way, having
      spontaneously composed on the spot an entirely new epitaph for himself, to
      the effect that Here lay the body of John Chivery, Who, Having at such a
      date, Beheld the idol of his life, In grief and tears, And feeling unable
      to bear the harrowing spectacle, Immediately repaired to the abode of his
      inconsolable parents, And terminated his existence by his own rash act.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There, there, Amy!’ said the Father, when Young John had closed the door,
      ‘let us say no more about it.’ The last few minutes had improved his
      spirits remarkably, and he was quite lightsome. ‘Where is my old pensioner
      all this while? We must not leave him by himself any longer, or he will
      begin to suppose he is not welcome, and that would pain me. Will you fetch
      him, my child, or shall I?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you wouldn’t mind, father,’ said Little Dorrit, trying to bring her
      sobbing to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Certainly I will go, my dear. I forgot; your eyes are rather red. There!
      Cheer up, Amy. Don’t be uneasy about me. I am quite myself again, my love,
      quite myself. Go to your room, Amy, and make yourself look comfortable and
      pleasant to receive Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I would rather stay in my own room, Father,’ returned Little Dorrit,
      finding it more difficult than before to regain her composure. ‘I would
      far rather not see Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh, fie, fie, my dear, that’s folly. Mr Clennam is a very gentlemanly man—very
      gentlemanly. A little reserved at times; but I will say extremely
      gentlemanly. I couldn’t think of your not being here to receive Mr
      Clennam, my dear, especially this afternoon. So go and freshen yourself
      up, Amy; go and freshen yourself up, like a good girl.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus directed, Little Dorrit dutifully rose and obeyed: only pausing for a
      moment as she went out of the room, to give her sister a kiss of
      reconciliation. Upon which, that young lady, feeling much harassed in her
      mind, and having for the time worn out the wish with which she generally
      relieved it, conceived and executed the brilliant idea of wishing Old
      Nandy dead, rather than that he should come bothering there like a
      disgusting, tiresome, wicked wretch, and making mischief between two
      sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea, even humming a tune, and wearing his black
      velvet cap a little on one side, so much improved were his spirits, went
      down into the yard, and found his old pensioner standing there hat in hand
      just within the gate, as he had stood all this time. ‘Come, Nandy!’ said
      he, with great suavity. ‘Come up-stairs, Nandy; you know the way; why
      don’t you come up-stairs?’ He went the length, on this occasion, of giving
      him his hand and saying, ‘How are you, Nandy? Are you pretty well?’ To
      which that vocalist returned, ‘I thank you, honoured sir, I am all the
      better for seeing your honour.’ As they went along the yard, the Father of
      the Marshalsea presented him to a Collegian of recent date. ‘An old
      acquaintance of mine, sir, an old pensioner.’ And then said, ‘Be covered,
      my good Nandy; put your hat on,’ with great consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      His patronage did not stop here; for he charged Maggy to get the tea
      ready, and instructed her to buy certain tea-cakes, fresh butter, eggs,
      cold ham, and shrimps: to purchase which collation he gave her a bank-note
      for ten pounds, laying strict injunctions on her to be careful of the
      change. These preparations were in an advanced stage of progress, and his
      daughter Amy had come back with her work, when Clennam presented himself;
      whom he most graciously received, and besought to join their meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy, my love, you know Mr Clennam even better than I have the happiness
      of doing. Fanny, my dear, you are acquainted with Mr Clennam.’ Fanny
      acknowledged him haughtily; the position she tacitly took up in all such
      cases being that there was a vast conspiracy to insult the family by not
      understanding it, or sufficiently deferring to it, and here was one of the
      conspirators. ‘This, Mr Clennam, you must know, is an old pensioner of
      mine, Old Nandy, a very faithful old man.’ (He always spoke of him as an
      object of great antiquity, but he was two or three years younger than
      himself.) ‘Let me see. You know Plornish, I think? I think my daughter Amy
      has mentioned to me that you know poor Plornish?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O yes!’ said Arthur Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, sir, this is Mrs Plornish’s father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed? I am glad to see him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You would be more glad if you knew his many good qualities, Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I hope I shall come to know them through knowing him,’ said Arthur,
      secretly pitying the bowed and submissive figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is a holiday with him, and he comes to see his old friends, who are
      always glad to see him,’ observed the Father of the Marshalsea. Then he
      added behind his hand, (‘Union, poor old fellow. Out for the day.’)
    </p>
<div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img src="images/0336m.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="0336m " /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0336.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      By this time Maggy, quietly assisted by her Little Mother, had spread the
      board, and the repast was ready. It being hot weather and the prison very
      close, the window was as wide open as it could be pushed. ‘If Maggy will
      spread that newspaper on the window-sill, my dear,’ remarked the Father
      complacently and in a half whisper to Little Dorrit, ‘my old pensioner can
      have his tea there, while we are having ours.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, with a gulf between him and the good company of about a foot in width,
      standard measure, Mrs Plornish’s father was handsomely regaled. Clennam
      had never seen anything like his magnanimous protection by that other
      Father, he of the Marshalsea; and was lost in the contemplation of its
      many wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most striking of these was perhaps the relishing manner in which he
      remarked on the pensioner’s infirmities and failings, as if he were a
      gracious Keeper making a running commentary on the decline of the harmless
      animal he exhibited.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not ready for more ham yet, Nandy? Why, how slow you are! (His last
      teeth,’ he explained to the company, ‘are going, poor old boy.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time, he said, ‘No shrimps, Nandy?’ and on his not instantly
      replying, observed, (‘His hearing is becoming very defective. He’ll be
      deaf directly.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time he asked him, ‘Do you walk much, Nandy, about the yard
      within the walls of that place of yours?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, sir; no. I haven’t any great liking for that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, to be sure,’ he assented. ‘Very natural.’ Then he privately informed
      the circle (‘Legs going.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he asked the pensioner, in that general clemency which asked him
      anything to keep him afloat, how old his younger grandchild was?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘John Edward,’ said the pensioner, slowly laying down his knife and fork
      to consider. ‘How old, sir? Let me think now.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea tapped his forehead (‘Memory weak.’)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘John Edward, sir? Well, I really forget. I couldn’t say at this minute,
      sir, whether it’s two and two months, or whether it’s two and five months.
      It’s one or the other.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t distress yourself by worrying your mind about it,’ he returned,
      with infinite forbearance. (‘Faculties evidently decaying—old man
      rusts in the life he leads!’)
    </p>
    <p>
      The more of these discoveries that he persuaded himself he made in the
      pensioner, the better he appeared to like him; and when he got out of his
      chair after tea to bid the pensioner good-bye, on his intimating that he
      feared, honoured sir, his time was running out, he made himself look as
      erect and strong as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘We don’t call this a shilling, Nandy, you know,’ he said, putting one in
      his hand. ‘We call it tobacco.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Honoured sir, I thank you. It shall buy tobacco. My thanks and duty to
      Miss Amy and Miss Fanny. I wish you good night, Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And mind you don’t forget us, you know, Nandy,’ said the Father. ‘You
      must come again, mind, whenever you have an afternoon. You must not come
      out without seeing us, or we shall be jealous. Good night, Nandy. Be very
      careful how you descend the stairs, Nandy; they are rather uneven and
      worn.’ With that he stood on the landing, watching the old man down: and
      when he came into the room again, said, with a solemn satisfaction on him,
      ‘A melancholy sight that, Mr Clennam, though one has the consolation of
      knowing that he doesn’t feel it himself. The poor old fellow is a dismal
      wreck. Spirit broken and gone—pulverised—crushed out of him,
      sir, completely!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Clennam had a purpose in remaining, he said what he could responsive to
      these sentiments, and stood at the window with their enunciator, while
      Maggy and her Little Mother washed the tea-service and cleared it away. He
      noticed that his companion stood at the window with the air of an affable
      and accessible Sovereign, and that, when any of his people in the yard
      below looked up, his recognition of their salutes just stopped short of a
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Little Dorrit had her work on the table, and Maggy hers on the
      bedstead, Fanny fell to tying her bonnet as a preliminary to her
      departure. Arthur, still having his purpose, still remained. At this time
      the door opened, without any notice, and Mr Tip came in. He kissed Amy as
      she started up to meet him, nodded to Fanny, nodded to his father, gloomed
      on the visitor without further recognition, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Tip, dear,’ said Little Dorrit, mildly, shocked by this, ‘don’t you see—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I see, Amy. If you refer to the presence of any visitor you have
      here—I say, if you refer to that,’ answered Tip, jerking his head
      with emphasis towards his shoulder nearest Clennam, ‘I see!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Is that all you say?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s all I say. And I suppose,’ added the lofty young man, after a
      moment’s pause, ‘that visitor will understand me, when I say that’s all I
      say. In short, I suppose the visitor will understand that he hasn’t used
      me like a gentleman.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do not understand that,’ observed the obnoxious personage referred to
      with tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No? Why, then, to make it clearer to you, sir, I beg to let you know that
      when I address what I call a properly-worded appeal, and an urgent appeal,
      and a delicate appeal, to an individual, for a small temporary
      accommodation, easily within his power—easily within his power,
      mind!—and when that individual writes back word to me that he begs
      to be excused, I consider that he doesn’t treat me like a gentleman.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Father of the Marshalsea, who had surveyed his son in silence, no
      sooner heard this sentiment, than he began in angry voice:—
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How dare you—’ But his son stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, don’t ask me how I dare, father, because that’s bosh. As to the fact
      of the line of conduct I choose to adopt towards the individual present,
      you ought to be proud of my showing a proper spirit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I should think so!’ cried Fanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A proper spirit?’ said the Father. ‘Yes, a proper spirit; a becoming
      spirit. Is it come to this that my son teaches me—<i>me</i>—spirit!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now, don’t let us bother about it, father, or have any row on the
      subject. I have fully made up my mind that the individual present has not
      treated me like a gentleman. And there’s an end of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But there is not an end of it, sir,’ returned the Father. ‘But there
      shall not be an end of it. You have made up your mind? You have made up
      your mind?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, <i>I</i> have. What’s the good of keeping on like that?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because,’ returned the Father, in a great heat, ‘you had no right to make
      up your mind to what is monstrous, to what is—ha—immoral, to
      what is—hum—parricidal. No, Mr Clennam, I beg, sir. Don’t ask
      me to desist; there is a—hum—a general principle involved
      here, which rises even above considerations of—ha—hospitality.
      I object to the assertion made by my son. I—ha—I personally
      repel it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, what is it to you, father?’ returned the son, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it to me, sir? I have a—hum—a spirit, sir, that will
      not endure it. I,’ he took out his pocket-handkerchief again and dabbed
      his face. ‘I am outraged and insulted by it. Let me suppose the case that
      I myself may at a certain time—ha—or times, have made a—hum—an
      appeal, and a properly-worded appeal, and a delicate appeal, and an urgent
      appeal to some individual for a small temporary accommodation. Let me
      suppose that that accommodation could have been easily extended, and was
      not extended, and that that individual informed me that he begged to be
      excused. Am I to be told by my own son, that I therefore received
      treatment not due to a gentleman, and that I—ha—I submitted to
      it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His daughter Amy gently tried to calm him, but he would not on any account
      be calmed. He said his spirit was up, and wouldn’t endure this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he to be told that, he wished to know again, by his own son on his own
      hearth, to his own face? Was that humiliation to be put upon him by his
      own blood?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are putting it on yourself, father, and getting into all this injury
      of your own accord!’ said the young gentleman morosely. ‘What I have made
      up my mind about has nothing to do with you. What I said had nothing to do
      with you. Why need you go trying on other people’s hats?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I reply it has everything to do with me,’ returned the Father. ‘I point
      out to you, sir, with indignation, that—hum—the—ha—delicacy
      and peculiarity of your father’s position should strike you dumb, sir, if
      nothing else should, in laying down such—ha—such unnatural
      principles. Besides; if you are not filial, sir, if you discard that duty,
      you are at least—hum—not a Christian? Are you—ha—an
      Atheist? And is it Christian, let me ask you, to stigmatise and denounce
      an individual for begging to be excused this time, when the same
      individual may—ha—respond with the required accommodation next
      time? Is it the part of a Christian not to—hum—not to try him
      again?’ He had worked himself into quite a religious glow and fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I see precious well,’ said Mr Tip, rising, ‘that I shall get no sensible
      or fair argument here to-night, and so the best thing I can do is to cut.
      Good night, Amy. Don’t be vexed. I am very sorry it happens here, and you
      here, upon my soul I am; but I can’t altogether part with my spirit, even
      for your sake, old girl.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words he put on his hat and went out, accompanied by Miss
      Fanny; who did not consider it spirited on her part to take leave of
      Clennam with any less opposing demonstration than a stare, importing that
      she had always known him for one of the large body of conspirators.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were gone, the Father of the Marshalsea was at first inclined to
      sink into despondency again, and would have done so, but that a gentleman
      opportunely came up within a minute or two to attend him to the Snuggery.
      It was the gentleman Clennam had seen on the night of his own accidental
      detention there, who had that impalpable grievance about the
      misappropriated Fund on which the Marshal was supposed to batten. He
      presented himself as deputation to escort the Father to the Chair, it
      being an occasion on which he had promised to preside over the assembled
      Collegians in the enjoyment of a little Harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Such, you see, Mr Clennam,’ said the Father, ‘are the incongruities of my
      position here. But a public duty! No man, I am sure, would more readily
      recognise a public duty than yourself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam besought him not to delay a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Amy, my dear, if you can persuade Mr Clennam to stay longer, I can leave
      the honours of our poor apology for an establishment with confidence in
      your hands, and perhaps you may do something towards erasing from Mr
      Clennam’s mind the—ha—untoward and unpleasant circumstance
      which has occurred since tea-time.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam assured him that it had made no impression on his mind, and
      therefore required no erasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear sir,’ said the Father, with a removal of his black cap and a
      grasp of Clennam’s hand, combining to express the safe receipt of his note
      and enclosure that afternoon, ‘Heaven ever bless you!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, at last, Clennam’s purpose in remaining was attained, and he could
      speak to Little Dorrit with nobody by. Maggy counted as nobody, and she
      was by.
    </p>

	</hgroup>
<p>Maggy sat at her work in her great white cap with its quantity of opaque
      frilling hiding what profile she had (she had none to spare), and her
      serviceable eye brought to bear upon her occupation, on the window side of
      the room. What with her flapping cap, and what with her unserviceable eye,
      she was quite partitioned off from her Little Mother, whose seat was
      opposite the window. The tread and shuffle of feet on the pavement of the
      yard had much diminished since the taking of the Chair, the tide of
      Collegians having set strongly in the direction of Harmony. Some few who
      had no music in their souls, or no money in their pockets, dawdled about;
      and the old spectacle of the visitor-wife and the depressed unseasoned
      prisoner still lingered in corners, as broken cobwebs and such unsightly
      discomforts draggle in corners of other places. It was the quietest time
      the College knew, saving the night hours when the Collegians took the
      benefit of the act of sleep. The occasional rattle of applause upon the
      tables of the Snuggery, denoted the successful termination of a morsel of
      Harmony; or the responsive acceptance, by the united children, of some
      toast or sentiment offered to them by their Father. Occasionally, a vocal
      strain more sonorous than the generality informed the listener that some
      boastful bass was in blue water, or in the hunting field, or with the
      reindeer, or on the mountain, or among the heather; but the Marshal of the
      Marshalsea knew better, and had got him hard and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Arthur Clennam moved to sit down by the side of Little Dorrit, she
      trembled so that she had much ado to hold her needle. Clennam gently put
      his hand upon her work, and said, ‘Dear Little Dorrit, let me lay it
      down.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She yielded it to him, and he put it aside. Her hands were then nervously
      clasping together, but he took one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How seldom I have seen you lately, Little Dorrit!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have been busy, sir.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I heard only to-day,’ said Clennam, ‘by mere accident, of your having
      been with those good people close by me. Why not come to me, then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I—I don’t know. Or rather, I thought you might be busy too. You
      generally are now, are you not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her trembling little form and her downcast face, and the eyes that
      drooped the moment they were raised to his—he saw them almost with
      as much concern as tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My child, your manner is so changed!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling was now quite beyond her control. Softly withdrawing her
      hand, and laying it in her other hand, she sat before him with her head
      bent and her whole form trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My own Little Dorrit,’ said Clennam, compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      She burst into tears. Maggy looked round of a sudden, and stared for at
      least a minute; but did not interpose. Clennam waited some little while
      before he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I cannot bear,’ he said then, ‘to see you weep; but I hope this is a
      relief to an overcharged heart.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes it is, sir. Nothing but that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well, well! I feared you would think too much of what passed here just
      now. It is of no moment; not the least. I am only unfortunate to have come
      in the way. Let it go by with these tears. It is not worth one of them.
      One of them? Such an idle thing should be repeated, with my glad consent,
      fifty times a day, to save you a moment’s heart-ache, Little Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken courage now, and answered, far more in her usual manner,
      ‘You are so good! But even if there was nothing else in it to be sorry for
      and ashamed of, it is such a bad return to you—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hush!’ said Clennam, smiling and touching her lips with his hand.
      ‘Forgetfulness in you who remember so many and so much, would be new
      indeed. Shall I remind you that I am not, and that I never was, anything
      but the friend whom you agreed to trust? No. You remember it, don’t you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I try to do so, or I should have broken the promise just now, when my
      mistaken brother was here. You will consider his bringing-up in this
      place, and will not judge him hardly, poor fellow, I know!’ In raising her
      eyes with these words, she observed his face more nearly than she had done
      yet, and said, with a quick change of tone, ‘You have not been ill, Mr
      Clennam?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nor tried? Nor hurt?’ she asked him, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell to Clennam now, to be not quite certain how to answer. He said in
      reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To speak the truth, I have been a little troubled, but it is over. Do I
      show it so plainly? I ought to have more fortitude and self-command than
      that. I thought I had. I must learn them of you. Who could teach me
      better!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He never thought that she saw in him what no one else could see. He never
      thought that in the whole world there were no other eyes that looked upon
      him with the same light and strength as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it brings me to something that I wish to say,’ he continued, ‘and
      therefore I will not quarrel even with my own face for telling tales and
      being unfaithful to me. Besides, it is a privilege and pleasure to confide
      in my Little Dorrit. Let me confess then, that, forgetting how grave I
      was, and how old I was, and how the time for such things had gone by me
      with the many years of sameness and little happiness that made up my long
      life far away, without marking it—that, forgetting all this, I
      fancied I loved some one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do I know her, sir?’ asked Little Dorrit.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, my child.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not the lady who has been kind to me for your sake?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Flora. No, no. Do you think—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I never quite thought so,’ said Little Dorrit, more to herself than him.
      ‘I did wonder at it a little.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Well!’ said Clennam, abiding by the feeling that had fallen on him in the
      avenue on the night of the roses, the feeling that he was an older man,
      who had done with that tender part of life, ‘I found out my mistake, and I
      thought about it a little—in short, a good deal—and got wiser.
      Being wiser, I counted up my years and considered what I am, and looked
      back, and looked forward, and found that I should soon be grey. I found
      that I had climbed the hill, and passed the level ground upon the top, and
      was descending quickly.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had known the sharpness of the pain he caused the patient heart, in
      speaking thus! While doing it, too, with the purpose of easing and serving
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I found that the day when any such thing would have been graceful in me,
      or good in me, or hopeful or happy for me or any one in connection with
      me, was gone, and would never shine again.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      O! If he had known, if he had known! If he could have seen the dagger in
      his hand, and the cruel wounds it struck in the faithful bleeding breast
      of his Little Dorrit!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All that is over, and I have turned my face from it. Why do I speak of
      this to Little Dorrit? Why do I show you, my child, the space of years
      that there is between us, and recall to you that I have passed, by the
      amount of your whole life, the time that is present to you?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Because you trust me, I hope. Because you know that nothing can touch you
      without touching me; that nothing can make you happy or unhappy, but it
      must make me, who am so grateful to you, the same.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the thrill in her voice, he saw her earnest face, he saw her
      clear true eyes, he saw the quickened bosom that would have joyfully
      thrown itself before him to receive a mortal wound directed at his breast,
      with the dying cry, ‘I love him!’ and the remotest suspicion of the truth
      never dawned upon his mind. No. He saw the devoted little creature with
      her worn shoes, in her common dress, in her jail-home; a slender child in
      body, a strong heroine in soul; and the light of her domestic story made
      all else dark to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For those reasons assuredly, Little Dorrit, but for another too. So far
      removed, so different, and so much older, I am the better fitted for your
      friend and adviser. I mean, I am the more easily to be trusted; and any
      little constraint that you might feel with another, may vanish before me.
      Why have you kept so retired from me? Tell me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am better here. My place and use are here. I am much better here,’ said
      Little Dorrit, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So you said that day upon the bridge. I thought of it much afterwards.
      Have you no secret you could entrust to me, with hope and comfort, if you
      would!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Secret? No, I have no secret,’ said Little Dorrit in some trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been speaking in low voices; more because it was natural to what
      they said to adopt that tone, than with any care to reserve it from Maggy
      at her work. All of a sudden Maggy stared again, and this time spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say! Little Mother!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, Maggy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘If you an’t got no secret of your own to tell him, tell him that about
      the Princess. <i>She</i> had a secret, you know.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The Princess had a secret?’ said Clennam, in some surprise. ‘What
      Princess was that, Maggy?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Lor! How you do go and bother a gal of ten,’ said Maggy, ‘catching the
      poor thing up in that way. Whoever said the Princess had a secret? <i>I</i>
      never said so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon. I thought you did.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No, I didn’t. How could I, when it was her as wanted to find it out? It
      was the little woman as had the secret, and she was always a spinning at
      her wheel. And so she says to her, why do you keep it there? And so the
      t’other one says to her, no I don’t; and so the t’other one says to her,
      yes you do; and then they both goes to the cupboard, and there it is. And
      she wouldn’t go into the Hospital, and so she died. <i>You</i> know,
      Little Mother; tell him that. For it was a reg’lar good secret, that was!’ 
      cried Maggy, hugging herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur looked at Little Dorrit for help to comprehend this, and was struck
      by seeing her so timid and red. But, when she told him that it was only a
      Fairy Tale she had one day made up for Maggy, and that there was nothing
      in it which she wouldn’t be ashamed to tell again to anybody else, even if
      she could remember it, he left the subject where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he returned to his own subject by first entreating her to see him
      oftener, and to remember that it was impossible to have a stronger
      interest in her welfare than he had, or to be more set upon promoting it
      than he was. When she answered fervently, she well knew that, she never
      forgot it, he touched upon his second and more delicate point—the
      suspicion he had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Little Dorrit,’ he said, taking her hand again, and speaking lower than
      he had spoken yet, so that even Maggy in the small room could not hear
      him, ‘another word. I have wanted very much to say this to you; I have
      tried for opportunities. Don’t mind me, who, for the matter of years,
      might be your father or your uncle. Always think of me as quite an old
      man. I know that all your devotion centres in this room, and that nothing
      to the last will ever tempt you away from the duties you discharge here.
      If I were not sure of it, I should, before now, have implored you, and
      implored your father, to let me make some provision for you in a more
      suitable place. But you may have an interest—I will not say, now,
      though even that might be—may have, at another time, an interest in
      some one else; an interest not incompatible with your affection here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very, very pale, and silently shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It may be, dear Little Dorrit.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No. No. No.’ She shook her head, after each slow repetition of the word,
      with an air of quiet desolation that he remembered long afterwards. The
      time came when he remembered it well, long afterwards, within those prison
      walls; within that very room.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, if it ever should be, tell me so, my dear child. Entrust the truth
      to me, point out the object of such an interest to me, and I will try with
      all the zeal, and honour, and friendship and respect that I feel for you,
      good Little Dorrit of my heart, to do you a lasting service.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘O thank you, thank you! But, O no, O no, O no!’ She said this, looking at
      him with her work-worn hands folded together, and in the same resigned
      accents as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I press for no confidence now. I only ask you to repose unhesitating
      trust in me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Can I do less than that, when you are so good!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then you will trust me fully? Will have no secret unhappiness, or
      anxiety, concealed from me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Almost none.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And you have none now?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. But she was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When I lie down to-night, and my thoughts come back—as they will,
      for they do every night, even when I have not seen you—to this sad
      place, I may believe that there is no grief beyond this room, now, and its
      usual occupants, which preys on Little Dorrit’s mind?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to catch at these words—that he remembered, too, long
      afterwards—and said, more brightly, ‘Yes, Mr Clennam; yes, you may!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crazy staircase, usually not slow to give notice when any one was
      coming up or down, here creaked under a quick tread, and a further sound
      was heard upon it, as if a little steam-engine with more steam than it
      knew what to do with, were working towards the room. As it approached,
      which it did very rapidly, it laboured with increased energy; and, after
      knocking at the door, it sounded as if it were stooping down and snorting
      in at the keyhole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Maggy could open the door, Mr Pancks, opening it from without,
      stood without a hat and with his bare head in the wildest condition,
      looking at Clennam and Little Dorrit, over her shoulder. He had a lighted
      cigar in his hand, and brought with him airs of ale and tobacco smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pancks the gipsy,’ he observed out of breath, ‘fortune-telling.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood dingily smiling, and breathing hard at them, with a most curious
      air; as if, instead of being his proprietor’s grubber, he were the
      triumphant proprietor of the Marshalsea, the Marshal, all the turnkeys,
      and all the Collegians. In his great self-satisfaction he put his cigar to
      his lips (being evidently no smoker), and took such a pull at it, with his
      right eye shut up tight for the purpose, that he underwent a convulsion of
      shuddering and choking. But even in the midst of that paroxysm, he still
      essayed to repeat his favourite introduction of himself, ‘Pa-ancks the
      gi-ipsy, fortune-telling.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am spending the evening with the rest of ‘em,’ said Pancks. ‘I’ve been
      singing. I’ve been taking a part in White sand and grey sand. <i>I</i>
      don’t know anything about it. Never mind. I’ll take any part in anything.
      It’s all the same, if you’re loud enough.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Clennam supposed him to be intoxicated. But he soon perceived
      that though he might be a little the worse (or better) for ale, the staple
      of his excitement was not brewed from malt, or distilled from any grain or
      berry.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How d’ye do, Miss Dorrit?’ said Pancks. ‘I thought you wouldn’t mind my
      running round, and looking in for a moment. Mr Clennam I heard was here,
      from Mr Dorrit. How are you, Sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam thanked him, and said he was glad to see him so gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Gay!’ said Pancks. ‘I’m in wonderful feather, sir. I can’t stop a minute,
      or I shall be missed, and I don’t want ‘em to miss me.—Eh, Miss
      Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to have an insatiate delight in appealing to her and looking at
      her; excitedly sticking his hair up at the same moment, like a dark
      species of cockatoo.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I haven’t been here half an hour. I knew Mr Dorrit was in the chair, and
      I said, “I’ll go and support him!” I ought to be down in Bleeding Heart
      Yard by rights; but I can worry them to-morrow.—Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His little black eyes sparkled electrically. His very hair seemed to
      sparkle as he roughened it. He was in that highly-charged state that one
      might have expected to draw sparks and snaps from him by presenting a
      knuckle to any part of his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Capital company here,’ said Pancks.—‘Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was half afraid of him, and irresolute what to say. He laughed, with a
      nod towards Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Don’t mind him, Miss Dorrit. He’s one of us. We agreed that you shouldn’t
      take on to mind me before people, but we didn’t mean Mr Clennam. He’s one
      of us. He’s in it. An’t you, Mr Clennam?—Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement of this strange creature was fast communicating itself to
      Clennam. Little Dorrit with amazement, saw this, and observed that they
      exchanged quick looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was making a remark,’ said Pancks, ‘but I declare I forget what it was.
      Oh, I know! Capital company here. I’ve been treating ‘em all round.—Eh,
      Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Very generous of you,’ she returned, noticing another of the quick looks
      between the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not at all,’ said Pancks. ‘Don’t mention it. I’m coming into my property,
      that’s the fact. I can afford to be liberal. I think I’ll give ‘em a treat
      here. Tables laid in the yard. Bread in stacks. Pipes in faggots. Tobacco
      in hayloads. Roast beef and plum-pudding for every one. Quart of double
      stout a head. Pint of wine too, if they like it, and the authorities give
      permission.—Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was thrown into such a confusion by his manner, or rather by Clennam’s
      growing understanding of his manner (for she looked to him after every
      fresh appeal and cockatoo demonstration on the part of Mr Pancks), that
      she only moved her lips in answer, without forming any word.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And oh, by-the-bye!’ said Pancks, ‘you were to live to know what was
      behind us on that little hand of yours. And so you shall, you shall, my
      darling.—Eh, Miss Dorrit?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had suddenly checked himself. Where he got all the additional black
      prongs from, that now flew up all over his head like the myriads of points
      that break out in the large change of a great firework, was a wonderful
      mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But I shall be missed;’ he came back to that; ‘and I don’t want ‘em to
      miss me. Mr Clennam, you and I made a bargain. I said you should find me
      stick to it. You shall find me stick to it now, sir, if you’ll step out of
      the room a moment. Miss Dorrit, I wish you good night. Miss Dorrit, I wish
      you good fortune.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He rapidly shook her by both hands, and puffed down stairs. Arthur
      followed him with such a hurried step, that he had very nearly tumbled
      over him on the last landing, and rolled him down into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it, for Heaven’s sake!’ Arthur demanded, when they burst out
      there both together.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stop a moment, sir. Mr Rugg. Let me introduce him.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words he presented another man without a hat, and also with a
      cigar, and also surrounded with a halo of ale and tobacco smoke, which
      man, though not so excited as himself, was in a state which would have
      been akin to lunacy but for its fading into sober method when compared
      with the rampancy of Mr Pancks.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, Mr Rugg,’ said Pancks. ‘Stop a moment. Come to the pump.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They adjourned to the pump. Mr Pancks, instantly putting his head under
      the spout, requested Mr Rugg to take a good strong turn at the handle. Mr
      Rugg complying to the letter, Mr Pancks came forth snorting and blowing to
      some purpose, and dried himself on his handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am the clearer for that,’ he gasped to Clennam standing astonished.
      ‘But upon my soul, to hear her father making speeches in that chair,
      knowing what we know, and to see her up in that room in that dress,
      knowing what we know, is enough to—give me a back, Mr Rugg—a
      little higher, sir,—that’ll do!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then and there, on that Marshalsea pavement, in the shades of evening, did
      Mr Pancks, of all mankind, fly over the head and shoulders of Mr Rugg of
      Pentonville, General Agent, Accountant, and Recoverer of Debts. Alighting
      on his feet, he took Clennam by the button-hole, led him behind the pump,
      and pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Rugg, also, pantingly produced from his pocket a bundle of papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Stay!’ said Clennam in a whisper.‘You have made a discovery.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Pancks answered, with an unction which there is no language to convey,
      ‘We rather think so.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Does it implicate any one?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How implicate, sir?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In any suppression or wrong dealing of any kind?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not a bit of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank God!’ said Clennam to himself. ‘Now show me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are to understand’—snorted Pancks, feverishly unfolding papers,
      and speaking in short high-pressure blasts of sentences, ‘Where’s the
      Pedigree? Where’s Schedule number four, Mr Rugg? Oh! all right! Here we
      are.—You are to understand that we are this very day virtually
      complete. We shan’t be legally for a day or two. Call it at the outside a
      week. We’ve been at it night and day for I don’t know how long. Mr Rugg,
      you know how long? Never mind. Don’t say. You’ll only confuse me. You
      shall tell her, Mr Clennam. Not till we give you leave. Where’s that rough
      total, Mr Rugg? Oh! Here we are! There sir! That’s what you’ll have to
      break to her. That man’s your Father of the Marshalsea!’

	<h3 epub:type="title">Mrs Merdle’s Complaint</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>Resigning herself to inevitable fate by making the best of those people,
      the Miggleses, and submitting her philosophy to the draught upon it, of
      which she had foreseen the likelihood in her interview with Arthur, Mrs
      Gowan handsomely resolved not to oppose her son’s marriage. In her
      progress to, and happy arrival at, this resolution, she was possibly
      influenced, not only by her maternal affections but by three politic
      considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of these, the first may have been that her son had never signified the
      smallest intention to ask her consent, or any mistrust of his ability to
      dispense with it; the second, that the pension bestowed upon her by a
      grateful country (and a Barnacle) would be freed from any little filial
      inroads, when her Henry should be married to the darling only child of a
      man in very easy circumstances; the third, that Henry’s debts must clearly
      be paid down upon the altar-railing by his father-in-law. When, to these
      three-fold points of prudence there is added the fact that Mrs Gowan
      yielded her consent the moment she knew of Mr Meagles having yielded his,
      and that Mr Meagles’s objection to the marriage had been the sole obstacle
      in its way all along, it becomes the height of probability that the relict
      of the deceased Commissioner of nothing particular, turned these ideas in
      her sagacious mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among her connections and acquaintances, however, she maintained her
      individual dignity and the dignity of the blood of the Barnacles, by
      diligently nursing the pretence that it was a most unfortunate business;
      that she was sadly cut up by it; that this was a perfect fascination under
      which Henry laboured; that she had opposed it for a long time, but what
      could a mother do; and the like. She had already called Arthur Clennam to
      bear witness to this fable, as a friend of the Meagles family; and she
      followed up the move by now impounding the family itself for the same
      purpose. In the first interview she accorded to Mr Meagles, she slided
      herself into the position of disconsolately but gracefully yielding to
      irresistible pressure. With the utmost politeness and good-breeding, she
      feigned that it was she—not he—who had made the difficulty,
      and who at length gave way; and that the sacrifice was hers—not his.
      The same feint, with the same polite dexterity, she foisted on Mrs
      Meagles, as a conjuror might have forced a card on that innocent lady;
      and, when her future daughter-in-law was presented to her by her son, she
      said on embracing her, ‘My dear, what have you done to Henry that has
      bewitched him so!’ at the same time allowing a few tears to carry before
      them, in little pills, the cosmetic powder on her nose; as a delicate but
      touching signal that she suffered much inwardly for the show of composure
      with which she bore her misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the friends of Mrs Gowan (who piqued herself at once on being
      Society, and on maintaining intimate and easy relations with that Power),
      Mrs Merdle occupied a front row. True, the Hampton Court Bohemians,
      without exception, turned up their noses at Merdle as an upstart; but they
      turned them down again, by falling flat on their faces to worship his
      wealth. In which compensating adjustment of their noses, they were pretty
      much like Treasury, Bar, and Bishop, and all the rest of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs Merdle, Mrs Gowan repaired on a visit of self-condolence, after
      having given the gracious consent aforesaid. She drove into town for the
      purpose in a one-horse carriage irreverently called at that period of
      English history, a pill-box. It belonged to a job-master in a small way,
      who drove it himself, and who jobbed it by the day, or hour, to most of
      the old ladies in Hampton Court Palace; but it was a point of ceremony, in
      that encampment, that the whole equipage should be tacitly regarded as the
      private property of the jobber for the time being, and that the job-master
      should betray personal knowledge of nobody but the jobber in possession.
      So the Circumlocution Barnacles, who were the largest job-masters in the
      universe, always pretended to know of no other job but the job immediately
      in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle was at home, and was in her nest of crimson and gold, with the
      parrot on a neighbouring stem watching her with his head on one side, as
      if he took her for another splendid parrot of a larger species. To whom
      entered Mrs Gowan, with her favourite green fan, which softened the light
      on the spots of bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear soul,’ said Mrs Gowan, tapping the back of her friend’s hand with
      this fan after a little indifferent conversation, ‘you are my only
      comfort. That affair of Henry’s that I told you of, is to take place. Now,
      how does it strike you? I am dying to know, because you represent and
      express Society so well.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle reviewed the bosom which Society was accustomed to review; and
      having ascertained that show-window of Mr Merdle’s and the London
      jewellers’ to be in good order, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘As to marriage on the part of a man, my dear, Society requires that he
      should retrieve his fortunes by marriage. Society requires that he should
      gain by marriage. Society requires that he should found a handsome
      establishment by marriage. Society does not see, otherwise, what he has to
      do with marriage. Bird, be quiet!’ 
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0351.jpg" style="width:100%;"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      For the parrot on his cage above them, presiding over the conference as if
      he were a judge (and indeed he looked rather like one), had wound up the
      exposition with a shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Cases there are,’ said Mrs Merdle, delicately crooking the little finger
      of her favourite hand, and making her remarks neater by that neat action;
      ‘cases there are where a man is not young or elegant, and is rich, and has
      a handsome establishment already. Those are of a different kind. In such
      cases—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle shrugged her snowy shoulders and put her hand upon the
      jewel-stand, checking a little cough, as though to add, ‘why, a man looks
      out for this sort of thing, my dear.’ Then the parrot shrieked again, and
      she put up her glass to look at him, and said, ‘Bird! Do be quiet!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, young men,’ resumed Mrs Merdle, ‘and by young men you know what I
      mean, my love—I mean people’s sons who have the world before them—they
      must place themselves in a better position towards Society by marriage, or
      Society really will not have any patience with their making fools of
      themselves. Dreadfully worldly all this sounds,’ said Mrs Merdle, leaning
      back in her nest and putting up her glass again, ‘does it not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it is true,’ said Mrs Gowan, with a highly moral air.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear, it is not to be disputed for a moment,’ returned Mrs Merdle;
      ‘because Society has made up its mind on the subject, and there is nothing
      more to be said. If we were in a more primitive state, if we lived under
      roofs of leaves, and kept cows and sheep and creatures instead of banker’s
      accounts (which would be delicious; my dear, I am pastoral to a degree, by
      nature), well and good. But we don’t live under leaves, and keep cows and
      sheep and creatures. I perfectly exhaust myself sometimes, in pointing out
      the distinction to Edmund Sparkler.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Gowan, looking over her green fan when this young gentleman’s name was
      mentioned, replied as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My love, you know the wretched state of the country—those
      unfortunate concessions of John Barnacle’s!—and you therefore know
      the reasons for my being as poor as Thingummy.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A church mouse?’ Mrs Merdle suggested with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I was thinking of the other proverbial church person—Job,’ said Mrs
      Gowan. ‘Either will do. It would be idle to disguise, consequently, that
      there is a wide difference between the position of your son and mine. I
      may add, too, that Henry has talent—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which Edmund certainly has not,’ said Mrs Merdle, with the greatest
      suavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘—and that his talent, combined with disappointment,’ Mrs Gowan went
      on, ‘has led him into a pursuit which—ah dear me! You know, my dear.
      Such being Henry’s different position, the question is what is the most
      inferior class of marriage to which I can reconcile myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle was so much engaged with the contemplation of her arms
      (beautiful-formed arms, and the very thing for bracelets), that she
      omitted to reply for a while. Roused at length by the silence, she folded
      the arms, and with admirable presence of mind looked her friend full in
      the face, and said interrogatively, ‘Ye-es? And then?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And then, my dear,’ said Mrs Gowan not quite so sweetly as before, ‘I
      should be glad to hear what you have to say to it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the parrot, who had been standing on one leg since he screamed last,
      burst into a fit of laughter, bobbed himself derisively up and down on
      both legs, and finished by standing on one leg again, and pausing for a
      reply, with his head as much awry as he could possibly twist it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Sounds mercenary to ask what the gentleman is to get with the lady,’ said
      Mrs Merdle; ‘but Society is perhaps a little mercenary, you know, my
      dear.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘From what I can make out,’ said Mrs Gowan, ‘I believe I may say that
      Henry will be relieved from debt—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Much in debt?’ asked Mrs Merdle through her eyeglass.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why tolerably, I should think,’ said Mrs Gowan.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Meaning the usual thing; I understand; just so,’ Mrs Merdle observed in a
      comfortable sort of way.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And that the father will make them an allowance of three hundred a-year,
      or perhaps altogether something more, which, in Italy-’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! Going to Italy?’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For Henry to study. You need be at no loss to guess why, my dear. That
      dreadful Art—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      True. Mrs Merdle hastened to spare the feelings of her afflicted friend.
      She understood. Say no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And that,’ said Mrs Gowan, shaking her despondent head, ‘that’s all.
      That,’ repeated Mrs Gowan, furling her green fan for the moment, and
      tapping her chin with it (it was on the way to being a double chin; might
      be called a chin and a half at present), ‘that’s all! On the death of the
      old people, I suppose there will be more to come; but how it may be
      restricted or locked up, I don’t know. And as to that, they may live for
      ever. My dear, they are just the kind of people to do it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mrs Merdle, who really knew her friend Society pretty well, and who
      knew what Society’s mothers were, and what Society’s daughters were, and
      what Society’s matrimonial market was, and how prices ruled in it, and
      what scheming and counter-scheming took place for the high buyers, and
      what bargaining and huckstering went on, thought in the depths of her
      capacious bosom that this was a sufficiently good catch. Knowing, however,
      what was expected of her, and perceiving the exact nature of the fiction
      to be nursed, she took it delicately in her arms, and put her required
      contribution of gloss upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And that is all, my dear?’ said she, heaving a friendly sigh. ‘Well,
      well! The fault is not yours. You have nothing to reproach yourself with.
      You must exercise the strength of mind for which you are renowned, and
      make the best of it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The girl’s family have made,’ said Mrs Gowan, ‘of course, the most
      strenuous endeavours to—as the lawyers say—to have and to hold
      Henry.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of course they have, my dear,’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have persisted in every possible objection, and have worried myself
      morning, noon, and night, for means to detach Henry from the connection.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt you have, my dear,’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And all of no use. All has broken down beneath me. Now tell me, my love.
      Am I justified in at last yielding my most reluctant consent to Henry’s
      marrying among people not in Society; or, have I acted with inexcusable
      weakness?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In answer to this direct appeal, Mrs Merdle assured Mrs Gowan (speaking as
      a Priestess of Society) that she was highly to be commended, that she was
      much to be sympathised with, that she had taken the highest of parts, and
      had come out of the furnace refined. And Mrs Gowan, who of course saw
      through her own threadbare blind perfectly, and who knew that Mrs Merdle
      saw through it perfectly, and who knew that Society would see through it
      perfectly, came out of this form, notwithstanding, as she had gone into
      it, with immense complacency and gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference was held at four or five o’clock in the afternoon, when all
      the region of Harley Street, Cavendish Square, was resonant of
      carriage-wheels and double-knocks. It had reached this point when Mr
      Merdle came home from his daily occupation of causing the British name to
      be more and more respected in all parts of the civilised globe capable of
      the appreciation of world-wide commercial enterprise and gigantic
      combinations of skill and capital. For, though nobody knew with the least
      precision what Mr Merdle’s business was, except that it was to coin money,
      these were the terms in which everybody defined it on all ceremonious
      occasions, and which it was the last new polite reading of the parable of
      the camel and the needle’s eye to accept without inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a gentleman who had this splendid work cut out for him, Mr Merdle
      looked a little common, and rather as if, in the course of his vast
      transactions, he had accidentally made an interchange of heads with some
      inferior spirit. He presented himself before the two ladies in the course
      of a dismal stroll through his mansion, which had no apparent object but
      escape from the presence of the chief butler.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I beg your pardon,’ he said, stopping short in confusion; ‘I didn’t know
      there was anybody here but the parrot.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as Mrs Merdle said, ‘You can come in!’ and as Mrs Gowan said she
      was just going, and had already risen to take her leave, he came in, and
      stood looking out at a distant window, with his hands crossed under his
      uneasy coat-cuffs, clasping his wrists as if he were taking himself into
      custody. In this attitude he fell directly into a reverie from which he
      was only aroused by his wife’s calling to him from her ottoman, when they
      had been for some quarter of an hour alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Eh? Yes?’ said Mr Merdle, turning towards her. ‘What is it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is it?’ repeated Mrs Merdle. ‘It is, I suppose, that you have not
      heard a word of my complaint.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your complaint, Mrs Merdle?’ said Mr Merdle. ‘I didn’t know that you were
      suffering from a complaint. What complaint?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A complaint of you,’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! A complaint of me,’ said Mr Merdle. ‘What is the—what have I—what
      may you have to complain of in me, Mrs Merdle?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his withdrawing, abstracted, pondering way, it took him some time to
      shape this question. As a kind of faint attempt to convince himself that
      he was the master of the house, he concluded by presenting his forefinger
      to the parrot, who expressed his opinion on that subject by instantly
      driving his bill into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You were saying, Mrs Merdle,’ said Mr Merdle, with his wounded finger in
      his mouth, ‘that you had a complaint against me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A complaint which I could scarcely show the justice of more emphatically,
      than by having to repeat it,’ said Mrs Merdle. ‘I might as well have
      stated it to the wall. I had far better have stated it to the bird. He
      would at least have screamed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You don’t want me to scream, Mrs Merdle, I suppose,’ said Mr Merdle,
      taking a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Indeed I don’t know,’ retorted Mrs Merdle, ‘but that you had better do
      that, than be so moody and distraught. One would at least know that you
      were sensible of what was going on around you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A man might scream, and yet not be that, Mrs Merdle,’ said Mr Merdle,
      heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And might be dogged, as you are at present, without screaming,’ returned
      Mrs Merdle. ‘That’s very true. If you wish to know the complaint I make
      against you, it is, in so many plain words, that you really ought not to
      go into Society unless you can accommodate yourself to Society.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle, so twisting his hands into what hair he had upon his head that
      he seemed to lift himself up by it as he started out of his chair, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why, in the name of all the infernal powers, Mrs Merdle, who does more
      for Society than I do? Do you see these premises, Mrs Merdle? Do you see
      this furniture, Mrs Merdle? Do you look in the glass and see yourself, Mrs
      Merdle? Do you know the cost of all this, and who it’s all provided for?
      And yet will you tell me that I oughtn’t to go into Society? I, who shower
      money upon it in this way? I, who might always be said—to—to—to
      harness myself to a watering-cart full of money, and go about saturating
      Society every day of my life.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray, don’t be violent, Mr Merdle,’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Violent?’ said Mr Merdle. ‘You are enough to make me desperate. You don’t
      know half of what I do to accommodate Society. You don’t know anything of
      the sacrifices I make for it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I know,’ returned Mrs Merdle, ‘that you receive the best in the land. I
      know that you move in the whole Society of the country. And I believe I
      know (indeed, not to make any ridiculous pretence about it, I know I know)
      who sustains you in it, Mr Merdle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Merdle,’ retorted that gentleman, wiping his dull red and yellow
      face, ‘I know that as well as you do. If you were not an ornament to
      Society, and if I was not a benefactor to Society, you and I would never
      have come together. When I say a benefactor to it, I mean a person who
      provides it with all sorts of expensive things to eat and drink and look
      at. But, to tell me that I am not fit for it after all I have done for it—after
      all I have done for it,’ repeated Mr Merdle, with a wild emphasis that
      made his wife lift up her eyelids, ‘after all—all!—to tell me
      I have no right to mix with it after all, is a pretty reward.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I say,’ answered Mrs Merdle composedly, ‘that you ought to make yourself
      fit for it by being more degage, and less preoccupied. There is a positive
      vulgarity in carrying your business affairs about with you as you do.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do I carry them about, Mrs Merdle?’ asked Mr Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘How do you carry them about?’ said Mrs Merdle. ‘Look at yourself in the
      glass.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle involuntarily turned his eyes in the direction of the nearest
      mirror, and asked, with a slow determination of his turbid blood to his
      temples, whether a man was to be called to account for his digestion?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have a physician,’ said Mrs Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He does me no good,’ said Mr Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Merdle changed her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Besides,’ said she, ‘your digestion is nonsense. I don’t speak of your
      digestion. I speak of your manner.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mrs Merdle,’ returned her husband, ‘I look to you for that. You supply
      manner, and I supply money.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t expect you,’ said Mrs Merdle, reposing easily among her cushions,
      ‘to captivate people. I don’t want you to take any trouble upon yourself,
      or to try to be fascinating. I simply request you to care about nothing—or
      seem to care about nothing—as everybody else does.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Do I ever say I care about anything?’ asked Mr Merdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Say? No! Nobody would attend to you if you did. But you show it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Show what? What do I show?’ demanded Mr Merdle hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I have already told you. You show that you carry your business cares an
      projects about, instead of leaving them in the City, or wherever else they
      belong to,’ said Mrs Merdle. ‘Or seeming to. Seeming would be quite
      enough: I ask no more. Whereas you couldn’t be more occupied with your
      day’s calculations and combinations than you habitually show yourself to
      be, if you were a carpenter.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A carpenter!’ repeated Mr Merdle, checking something like a groan. ‘I
      shouldn’t so much mind being a carpenter, Mrs Merdle.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And my complaint is,’ pursued the lady, disregarding the low remark,
      ‘that it is not the tone of Society, and that you ought to correct it, Mr
      Merdle. If you have any doubt of my judgment, ask even Edmund Sparkler.’ 
      The door of the room had opened, and Mrs Merdle now surveyed the head of
      her son through her glass. ‘Edmund; we want you here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Sparkler, who had merely put in his head and looked round the room
      without entering (as if he were searching the house for that young lady
      with no nonsense about her), upon this followed up his head with his body,
      and stood before them. To whom, in a few easy words adapted to his
      capacity, Mrs Merdle stated the question at issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman, after anxiously feeling his shirt-collar as if it
      were his pulse and he were hypochondriacal, observed, ‘That he had heard
      it noticed by fellers.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Edmund Sparkler has heard it noticed,’ said Mrs Merdle, with languid
      triumph. ‘Why, no doubt everybody has heard it noticed!’ Which in truth
      was no unreasonable inference; seeing that Mr Sparkler would probably be
      the last person, in any assemblage of the human species, to receive an
      impression from anything that passed in his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And Edmund Sparkler will tell you, I dare say,’ said Mrs Merdle, waving
      her favourite hand towards her husband, ‘how he has heard it noticed.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I couldn’t,’ said Mr Sparkler, after feeling his pulse as before,
      ‘couldn’t undertake to say what led to it—‘cause memory desperate
      loose. But being in company with the brother of a doosed fine gal—well
      educated too—with no biggodd nonsense about her—at the period
      alluded to—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘There! Never mind the sister,’ remarked Mrs Merdle, a little impatiently.
      ‘What did the brother say?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Didn’t say a word, ma’am,’ answered Mr Sparkler. ‘As silent a feller as
      myself. Equally hard up for a remark.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Somebody said something,’ returned Mrs Merdle. ‘Never mind who it was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (‘Assure you I don’t in the least,’ said Mr Sparkler.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But tell us what it was.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Sparkler referred to his pulse again, and put himself through some
      severe mental discipline before he replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fellers referring to my Governor—expression not my own—occasionally
      compliment my Governor in a very handsome way on being immensely rich and
      knowing—perfect phenomenon of Buyer and Banker and that—but
      say the Shop sits heavily on him. Say he carried the Shop about, on his
      back rather—like Jew clothesmen with too much business.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Which,’ said Mrs Merdle, rising, with her floating drapery about her, ‘is
      exactly my complaint. Edmund, give me your arm up-stairs.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merdle, left alone to meditate on a better conformation of himself to
      Society, looked out of nine windows in succession, and appeared to see
      nine wastes of space. When he had thus entertained himself he went
      down-stairs, and looked intently at all the carpets on the ground-floor;
      and then came up-stairs again, and looked intently at all the carpets on
      the first-floor; as if they were gloomy depths, in unison with his
      oppressed soul. Through all the rooms he wandered, as he always did, like
      the last person on earth who had any business to approach them. Let Mrs
      Merdle announce, with all her might, that she was at Home ever so many
      nights in a season, she could not announce more widely and unmistakably
      than Mr Merdle did that he was never at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he met the chief butler, the sight of which splendid retainer
      always finished him. Extinguished by this great creature, he sneaked to
      his dressing-room, and there remained shut up until he rode out to dinner,
      with Mrs Merdle, in her own handsome chariot. At dinner, he was envied and
      flattered as a being of might, was Treasuried, Barred, and Bishoped, as
      much as he would; and an hour after midnight came home alone, and being
      instantly put out again in his own hall, like a rushlight, by the chief
      butler, went sighing to bed.

	<h2 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">34</h2>
	<h3 epub:type="title">A Shoal of Barnacles</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>Mr Henry Gowan and the dog were established frequenters of the cottage,
      and the day was fixed for the wedding. There was to be a convocation of
      Barnacles on the occasion, in order that that very high and very large
      family might shed as much lustre on the marriage as so dim an event was
      capable of receiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      To have got the whole Barnacle family together would have been impossible
      for two reasons. Firstly, because no building could have held all the
      members and connections of that illustrious house. Secondly, because
      wherever there was a square yard of ground in British occupation under the
      sun or moon, with a public post upon it, sticking to that post was a
      Barnacle. No intrepid navigator could plant a flag-staff upon any spot of
      earth, and take possession of it in the British name, but to that spot of
      earth, so soon as the discovery was known, the Circumlocution Office sent
      out a Barnacle and a despatch-box. Thus the Barnacles were all over the
      world, in every direction—despatch-boxing the compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, while the so-potent art of Prospero himself would have failed in
      summoning the Barnacles from every speck of ocean and dry land on which
      there was nothing (except mischief) to be done and anything to be
      pocketed, it was perfectly feasible to assemble a good many Barnacles.
      This Mrs Gowan applied herself to do; calling on Mr Meagles frequently
      with new additions to the list, and holding conferences with that
      gentleman when he was not engaged (as he generally was at this period) in
      examining and paying the debts of his future son-in-law, in the apartment
      of scales and scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      One marriage guest there was, in reference to whose presence Mr Meagles
      felt a nearer interest and concern than in the attendance of the most
      elevated Barnacle expected; though he was far from insensible of the
      honour of having such company. This guest was Clennam. But Clennam had
      made a promise he held sacred, among the trees that summer night, and, in
      the chivalry of his heart, regarded it as binding him to many implied
      obligations. In forgetfulness of himself, and delicate service to her on
      all occasions, he was never to fail; to begin it, he answered Mr Meagles
      cheerfully, ‘I shall come, of course.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His partner, Daniel Doyce, was something of a stumbling-block in Mr
      Meagles’s way, the worthy gentleman being not at all clear in his own
      anxious mind but that the mingling of Daniel with official Barnacleism
      might produce some explosive combination, even at a marriage breakfast.
      The national offender, however, lightened him of his uneasiness by coming
      down to Twickenham to represent that he begged, with the freedom of an old
      friend, and as a favour to one, that he might not be invited. ‘For,’ said
      he, ‘as my business with this set of gentlemen was to do a public duty and
      a public service, and as their business with me was to prevent it by
      wearing my soul out, I think we had better not eat and drink together with
      a show of being of one mind.’ Mr Meagles was much amused by his friend’s
      oddity; and patronised him with a more protecting air of allowance than
      usual, when he rejoined: ‘Well, well, Dan, you shall have your own
      crotchety way.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mr Henry Gowan, as the time approached, Clennam tried to convey by all
      quiet and unpretending means, that he was frankly and disinterestedly
      desirous of tendering him any friendship he would accept. Mr Gowan treated
      him in return with his usual ease, and with his usual show of confidence,
      which was no confidence at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You see, Clennam,’ he happened to remark in the course of conversation
      one day, when they were walking near the Cottage within a week of the
      marriage, ‘I am a disappointed man. That you know already.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Upon my word,’ said Clennam, a little embarrassed, ‘I scarcely know how.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Why,’ returned Gowan, ‘I belong to a clan, or a clique, or a family, or a
      connection, or whatever you like to call it, that might have provided for
      me in any one of fifty ways, and that took it into its head not to do it
      at all. So here I am, a poor devil of an artist.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam was beginning, ‘But on the other hand—’ when Gowan took him
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, yes, I know. I have the good fortune of being beloved by a beautiful
      and charming girl whom I love with all my heart.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      (‘Is there much of it?’ Clennam thought. And as he thought it, felt
      ashamed of himself.)
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And of finding a father-in-law who is a capital fellow and a liberal good
      old boy. Still, I had other prospects washed and combed into my childish
      head when it was washed and combed for me, and I took them to a public
      school when I washed and combed it for myself, and I am here without them,
      and thus I am a disappointed man.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam thought (and as he thought it, again felt ashamed of himself), was
      this notion of being disappointed in life, an assertion of station which
      the bridegroom brought into the family as his property, having already
      carried it detrimentally into his pursuit? And was it a hopeful or a
      promising thing anywhere?
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Not bitterly disappointed, I think,’ he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hang it, no; not bitterly,’ laughed Gowan. ‘My people are not worth that—though
      they are charming fellows, and I have the greatest affection for them.
      Besides, it’s pleasant to show them that I can do without them, and that
      they may all go to the Devil. And besides, again, most men are
      disappointed in life, somehow or other, and influenced by their
      disappointment. But it’s a dear good world, and I love it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It lies fair before you now,’ said Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Fair as this summer river,’ cried the other, with enthusiasm, ‘and by
      Jove I glow with admiration of it, and with ardour to run a race in it.
      It’s the best of old worlds! And my calling! The best of old callings,
      isn’t it?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Full of interest and ambition, I conceive,’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And imposition,’ added Gowan, laughing; ‘we won’t leave out the
      imposition. I hope I may not break down in that; but there, my being a
      disappointed man may show itself. I may not be able to face it out gravely
      enough. Between you and me, I think there is some danger of my being just
      enough soured not to be able to do that.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To do what?’ asked Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘To keep it up. To help myself in my turn, as the man before me helps
      himself in his, and pass the bottle of smoke. To keep up the pretence as
      to labour, and study, and patience, and being devoted to my art, and
      giving up many solitary days to it, and abandoning many pleasures for it,
      and living in it, and all the rest of it—in short, to pass the
      bottle of smoke according to rule.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But it is well for a man to respect his own vocation, whatever it is; and
      to think himself bound to uphold it, and to claim for it the respect it
      deserves; is it not?’ Arthur reasoned. ‘And your vocation, Gowan, may
      really demand this suit and service. I confess I should have thought that
      all Art did.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What a good fellow you are, Clennam!’ exclaimed the other, stopping to
      look at him, as if with irrepressible admiration. ‘What a capital fellow!
      <i>You</i> have never been disappointed. That’s easy to see.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been so cruel if he had meant it, that Clennam firmly
      resolved to believe he did not mean it. Gowan, without pausing, laid his
      hand upon his shoulder, and laughingly and lightly went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Clennam, I don’t like to dispel your generous visions, and I would give
      any money (if I had any), to live in such a rose-coloured mist. But what I
      do in my trade, I do to sell. What all we fellows do, we do to sell. If we
      didn’t want to sell it for the most we can get for it, we shouldn’t do it.
      Being work, it has to be done; but it’s easily enough done. All the rest
      is hocus-pocus. Now here’s one of the advantages, or disadvantages, of
      knowing a disappointed man. You hear the truth.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever he had heard, and whether it deserved that name or another, it
      sank into Clennam’s mind. It so took root there, that he began to fear
      Henry Gowan would always be a trouble to him, and that so far he had
      gained little or nothing from the dismissal of Nobody, with all his
      inconsistencies, anxieties, and contradictions. He found a contest still
      always going on in his breast between his promise to keep Gowan in none
      but good aspects before the mind of Mr Meagles, and his enforced
      observation of Gowan in aspects that had no good in them. Nor could he
      quite support his own conscientious nature against misgivings that he
      distorted and discoloured himself, by reminding himself that he never
      sought those discoveries, and that he would have avoided them with
      willingness and great relief. For he never could forget what he had been;
      and he knew that he had once disliked Gowan for no better reason than that
      he had come in his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harassed by these thoughts, he now began to wish the marriage over, Gowan
      and his young wife gone, and himself left to fulfil his promise, and
      discharge the generous function he had accepted. This last week was, in
      truth, an uneasy interval for the whole house. Before Pet, or before
      Gowan, Mr Meagles was radiant; but Clennam had more than once found him
      alone, with his view of the scales and scoop much blurred, and had often
      seen him look after the lovers, in the garden or elsewhere when he was not
      seen by them, with the old clouded face on which Gowan had fallen like a
      shadow. In the arrangement of the house for the great occasion, many
      little reminders of the old travels of the father and mother and daughter
      had to be disturbed and passed from hand to hand; and sometimes, in the
      midst of these mute witnesses, to the life they had had together, even Pet
      herself would yield to lamenting and weeping. Mrs Meagles, the blithest
      and busiest of mothers, went about singing and cheering everybody; but
      she, honest soul, had her flights into store rooms, where she would cry
      until her eyes were red, and would then come out, attributing that
      appearance to pickled onions and pepper, and singing clearer than ever.
      Mrs Tickit, finding no balsam for a wounded mind in Buchan’s Domestic
      Medicine, suffered greatly from low spirits, and from moving recollections
      of Minnie’s infancy. When the latter was powerful with her, she usually
      sent up secret messages importing that she was not in parlour condition as
      to her attire, and that she solicited a sight of ‘her child’ in the
      kitchen; there, she would bless her child’s face, and bless her child’s
      heart, and hug her child, in a medley of tears and congratulations,
      chopping-boards, rolling-pins, and pie-crust, with the tenderness of an
      old attached servant, which is a very pretty tenderness indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all days come that are to be; and the marriage-day was to be, and it
      came; and with it came all the Barnacles who were bidden to the feast.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Mr Tite Barnacle, from the Circumlocution Office, and Mews
      Street, Grosvenor Square, with the expensive Mrs Tite Barnacle <i>nee</i>
      Stiltstalking, who made the Quarter Days so long in coming, and the three
      expensive Miss Tite Barnacles, double-loaded with accomplishments and
      ready to go off, and yet not going off with the sharpness of flash and
      bang that might have been expected, but rather hanging fire. There was
      Barnacle junior, also from the Circumlocution Office, leaving the Tonnage
      of the country, which he was somehow supposed to take under his
      protection, to look after itself, and, sooth to say, not at all impairing
      the efficiency of its protection by leaving it alone. There was the
      engaging Young Barnacle, deriving from the sprightly side of the family,
      also from the Circumlocution Office, gaily and agreeably helping the
      occasion along, and treating it, in his sparkling way, as one of the
      official forms and fees of the Church Department of How not to do it.
      There were three other Young Barnacles from three other offices, insipid
      to all the senses, and terribly in want of seasoning, doing the marriage
      as they would have ‘done’ the Nile, Old Rome, the new singer, or
      Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was greater game than this. There was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle
      himself, in the odour of Circumlocution—with the very smell of
      Despatch-Boxes upon him. Yes, there was Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle, who
      had risen to official heights on the wings of one indignant idea, and that
      was, My Lords, that I am yet to be told that it behoves a Minister of this
      free country to set bounds to the philanthropy, to cramp the charity, to
      fetter the public spirit, to contract the enterprise, to damp the
      independent self-reliance, of its people. That was, in other words, that
      this great statesman was always yet to be told that it behoved the Pilot
      of the ship to do anything but prosper in the private loaf and fish trade
      ashore, the crew being able, by dint of hard pumping, to keep the ship
      above water without him. On this sublime discovery in the great art How
      not to do it, Lord Decimus had long sustained the highest glory of the
      Barnacle family; and let any ill-advised member of either House but try
      How to do it by bringing in a Bill to do it, that Bill was as good as dead
      and buried when Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle rose up in his place and
      solemnly said, soaring into indignant majesty as the Circumlocution
      cheering soared around him, that he was yet to be told, My Lords, that it
      behoved him as the Minister of this free country, to set bounds to the
      philanthropy, to cramp the charity, to fetter the public spirit, to
      contract the enterprise, to damp the independent self-reliance, of its
      people. The discovery of this Behoving Machine was the discovery of the
      political perpetual motion. It never wore out, though it was always going
      round and round in all the State Departments.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, with his noble friend and relative Lord Decimus, was William
      Barnacle, who had made the ever-famous coalition with Tudor Stiltstalking,
      and who always kept ready his own particular recipe for How not to do it;
      sometimes tapping the Speaker, and drawing it fresh out of him, with a
      ‘First, I will beg you, sir, to inform the House what Precedent we have
      for the course into which the honourable gentleman would precipitate us;’ 
      sometimes asking the honourable gentleman to favour him with his own
      version of the Precedent; sometimes telling the honourable gentleman that
      he (William Barnacle) would search for a Precedent; and oftentimes
      crushing the honourable gentleman flat on the spot by telling him there
      was no Precedent. But Precedent and Precipitate were, under all
      circumstances, the well-matched pair of battle-horses of this able
      Circumlocutionist. No matter that the unhappy honourable gentleman had
      been trying in vain, for twenty-five years, to precipitate William
      Barnacle into this—William Barnacle still put it to the House, and
      (at second-hand or so) to the country, whether he was to be precipitated
      into this. No matter that it was utterly irreconcilable with the nature of
      things and course of events that the wretched honourable gentleman could
      possibly produce a Precedent for this—William Barnacle would
      nevertheless thank the honourable gentleman for that ironical cheer, and
      would close with him upon that issue, and would tell him to his teeth that
      there Was NO Precedent for this. It might perhaps have been objected that
      the William Barnacle wisdom was not high wisdom or the earth it bamboozled
      would never have been made, or, if made in a rash mistake, would have
      remained blank mud. But Precedent and Precipitate together frightened all
      objection out of most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, too, was another Barnacle, a lively one, who had leaped through
      twenty places in quick succession, and was always in two or three at once,
      and who was the much-respected inventor of an art which he practised with
      great success and admiration in all Barnacle Governments. This was, when
      he was asked a Parliamentary question on any one topic, to return an
      answer on any other. It had done immense service, and brought him into
      high esteem with the Circumlocution Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there, too, was a sprinkling of less distinguished Parliamentary
      Barnacles, who had not as yet got anything snug, and were going through
      their probation to prove their worthiness. These Barnacles perched upon
      staircases and hid in passages, waiting their orders to make houses or not
      to make houses; and they did all their hearing, and ohing, and cheering,
      and barking, under directions from the heads of the family; and they put
      dummy motions on the paper in the way of other men’s motions; and they
      stalled disagreeable subjects off until late in the night and late in the
      session, and then with virtuous patriotism cried out that it was too late;
      and they went down into the country, whenever they were sent, and swore
      that Lord Decimus had revived trade from a swoon, and commerce from a fit,
      and had doubled the harvest of corn, quadrupled the harvest of hay, and
      prevented no end of gold from flying out of the Bank. Also these Barnacles
      were dealt, by the heads of the family, like so many cards below the
      court-cards, to public meetings and dinners; where they bore testimony to
      all sorts of services on the part of their noble and honourable relatives,
      and buttered the Barnacles on all sorts of toasts. And they stood, under
      similar orders, at all sorts of elections; and they turned out of their
      own seats, on the shortest notice and the most unreasonable terms, to let
      in other men; and they fetched and carried, and toadied and jobbed, and
      corrupted, and ate heaps of dirt, and were indefatigable in the public
      service. And there was not a list, in all the Circumlocution Office, of
      places that might fall vacant anywhere within half a century, from a lord
      of the Treasury to a Chinese consul, and up again to a governor-general of
      India, but as applicants for such places, the names of some or of every
      one of these hungry and adhesive Barnacles were down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was necessarily but a sprinkling of any class of Barnacles that
      attended the marriage, for there were not two score in all, and what is
      that subtracted from Legion! But the sprinkling was a swarm in the
      Twickenham cottage, and filled it. A Barnacle (assisted by a Barnacle)
      married the happy pair, and it behoved Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle himself
      to conduct Mrs Meagles to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entertainment was not as agreeable and natural as it might have been.
      Mr Meagles, hove down by his good company while he highly appreciated it,
      was not himself. Mrs Gowan was herself, and that did not improve him. The
      fiction that it was not Mr Meagles who had stood in the way, but that it
      was the Family greatness, and that the Family greatness had made a
      concession, and there was now a soothing unanimity, pervaded the affair,
      though it was never openly expressed. Then the Barnacles felt that they
      for their parts would have done with the Meagleses when the present
      patronising occasion was over; and the Meagleses felt the same for their
      parts. Then Gowan asserting his rights as a disappointed man who had his
      grudge against the family, and who, perhaps, had allowed his mother to
      have them there, as much in the hope it might give them some annoyance as
      with any other benevolent object, aired his pencil and his poverty
      ostentatiously before them, and told them he hoped in time to settle a
      crust of bread and cheese on his wife, and that he begged such of them as
      (more fortunate than himself) came in for any good thing, and could buy a
      picture, to please to remember the poor painter. Then Lord Decimus, who
      was a wonder on his own Parliamentary pedestal, turned out to be the
      windiest creature here: proposing happiness to the bride and bridegroom in
      a series of platitudes that would have made the hair of any sincere
      disciple and believer stand on end; and trotting, with the complacency of
      an idiotic elephant, among howling labyrinths of sentences which he seemed
      to take for high roads, and never so much as wanted to get out of. Then Mr
      Tite Barnacle could not but feel that there was a person in company, who
      would have disturbed his life-long sitting to Sir Thomas Lawrence in full
      official character, if such disturbance had been possible: while Barnacle
      junior did, with indignation, communicate to two vapid gentlemen, his
      relatives, that there was a feller here, look here, who had come to our
      Department without an appointment and said he wanted to know, you know;
      and that, look here, if he was to break out now, as he might you know (for
      you never could tell what an ungentlemanly Radical of that sort would be
      up to next), and was to say, look here, that he wanted to know this
      moment, you know, that would be jolly; wouldn’t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The pleasantest part of the occasion by far, to Clennam, was the
      painfullest. When Mr and Mrs Meagles at last hung about Pet in the room
      with the two pictures (where the company were not), before going with her
      to the threshold which she could never recross to be the old Pet and the
      old delight, nothing could be more natural and simple than the three were.
      Gowan himself was touched, and answered Mr Meagles’s ‘O Gowan, take care
      of her, take care of her!’ with an earnest ‘Don’t be so broken-hearted,
      sir. By Heaven I will!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with the last sobs and last loving words, and a last look to
      Clennam of confidence in his promise, Pet fell back in the carriage, and
      her husband waved his hand, and they were away for Dover; though not until
      the faithful Mrs Tickit, in her silk gown and jet black curls, had rushed
      out from some hiding-place, and thrown both her shoes after the carriage:
      an apparition which occasioned great surprise to the distinguished company
      at the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said company being now relieved from further attendance, and the chief
      Barnacles being rather hurried (for they had it in hand just then to send
      a mail or two which was in danger of going straight to its destination,
      beating about the seas like the Flying Dutchman, and to arrange with
      complexity for the stoppage of a good deal of important business otherwise
      in peril of being done), went their several ways; with all affability
      conveying to Mr and Mrs Meagles that general assurance that what they had
      been doing there, they had been doing at a sacrifice for Mr and Mrs
      Meagles’s good, which they always conveyed to Mr John Bull in their
      official condescension to that most unfortunate creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      A miserable blank remained in the house and in the hearts of the father
      and mother and Clennam. Mr Meagles called only one remembrance to his aid,
      that really did him good.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It’s very gratifying, Arthur,’ he said, ‘after all, to look back upon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘The past?’ said Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes—but I mean the company.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It had made him much more low and unhappy at the time, but now it really
      did him good. ‘It’s very gratifying,’ he said, often repeating the remark
      in the course of the evening. ‘Such high company!’

	<h3 epub:type="title">What was behind Mr Pancks on Little Dorrit’s Hand</h3>
	</hgroup>
<p>It was at this time that Mr Pancks, in discharge of his compact with
      Clennam, revealed to him the whole of his gipsy story, and told him Little
      Dorrit’s fortune. Her father was heir-at-law to a great estate that had
      long lain unknown of, unclaimed, and accumulating. His right was now
      clear, nothing interposed in his way, the Marshalsea gates stood open, the
      Marshalsea walls were down, a few flourishes of his pen, and he was
      extremely rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his tracking out of the claim to its complete establishment, Mr Pancks
      had shown a sagacity that nothing could baffle, and a patience and secrecy
      that nothing could tire. ‘I little thought, sir,’ said Pancks, ‘when you
      and I crossed Smithfield that night, and I told you what sort of a
      Collector I was, that this would come of it. I little thought, sir, when I
      told you you were not of the Clennams of Cornwall, that I was ever going
      to tell you who were of the Dorrits of Dorsetshire.’ He then went on to
      detail. How, having that name recorded in his note-book, he was first
      attracted by the name alone. How, having often found two exactly similar
      names, even belonging to the same place, to involve no traceable
      consanguinity, near or distant, he did not at first give much heed to
      this, except in the way of speculation as to what a surprising change
      would be made in the condition of a little seamstress, if she could be
      shown to have any interest in so large a property. How he rather supposed
      himself to have pursued the idea into its next degree, because there was
      something uncommon in the quiet little seamstress, which pleased him and
      provoked his curiosity. How he had felt his way inch by inch, and ‘Moled
      it out, sir’ (that was Mr Pancks’s expression), grain by grain. How, in
      the beginning of the labour described by this new verb, and to render
      which the more expressive Mr Pancks shut his eyes in pronouncing it and
      shook his hair over them, he had alternated from sudden lights and hopes
      to sudden darkness and no hopes, and back again, and back again. How he
      had made acquaintances in the Prison, expressly that he might come and go
      there as all other comers and goers did; and how his first ray of light
      was unconsciously given him by Mr Dorrit himself and by his son; to both
      of whom he easily became known; with both of whom he talked much, casually
      (‘but always Moleing you’ll observe,’ said Mr Pancks): and from whom he
      derived, without being at all suspected, two or three little points of
      family history which, as he began to hold clues of his own, suggested
      others. How it had at length become plain to Mr Pancks that he had made a
      real discovery of the heir-at-law to a great fortune, and that his
      discovery had but to be ripened to legal fulness and perfection. How he
      had, thereupon, sworn his landlord, Mr Rugg, to secrecy in a solemn
      manner, and taken him into Moleing partnership. How they had employed John
      Chivery as their sole clerk and agent, seeing to whom he was devoted. And
      how, until the present hour, when authorities mighty in the Bank and
      learned in the law declared their successful labours ended, they had
      confided in no other human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘So if the whole thing had broken down, sir,’ concluded Pancks, ‘at the
      very last, say the day before the other day when I showed you our papers
      in the Prison yard, or say that very day, nobody but ourselves would have
      been cruelly disappointed, or a penny the worse.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam, who had been almost incessantly shaking hands with him throughout
      the narrative, was reminded by this to say, in an amazement which even the
      preparation he had had for the main disclosure smoothed down, ‘My dear Mr
      Pancks, this must have cost you a great sum of money.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pretty well, sir,’ said the triumphant Pancks. ‘No trifle, though we did
      it as cheap as it could be done. And the outlay was a difficulty, let me
      tell you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A difficulty!’ repeated Clennam. ‘But the difficulties you have so
      wonderfully conquered in the whole business!’ shaking his hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I’ll tell you how I did it,’ said the delighted Pancks, putting his hair
      into a condition as elevated as himself. ‘First, I spent all I had of my
      own. That wasn’t much.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I am sorry for it,’ said Clennam: ‘not that it matters now, though. Then,
      what did you do?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then,’ answered Pancks, ‘I borrowed a sum of my proprietor.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Of Mr Casby?’ said Clennam. ‘He’s a fine old fellow.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Noble old boy; an’t he?’ said Mr Pancks, entering on a series of the
      dryest snorts. ‘Generous old buck. Confiding old boy. Philanthropic old
      buck. Benevolent old boy! Twenty per cent. I engaged to pay him, sir. But
      we never do business for less at our shop.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur felt an awkward consciousness of having, in his exultant condition,
      been a little premature.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I said to that boiling-over old Christian,’ Mr Pancks pursued, appearing
      greatly to relish this descriptive epithet, ‘that I had got a little
      project on hand; a hopeful one; I told him a hopeful one; which wanted a
      certain small capital. I proposed to him to lend me the money on my note.
      Which he did, at twenty; sticking the twenty on in a business-like way,
      and putting it into the note, to look like a part of the principal. If I
      had broken down after that, I should have been his grubber for the next
      seven years at half wages and double grind. But he’s a perfect Patriarch;
      and it would do a man good to serve him on such terms—on any terms.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur for his life could not have said with confidence whether Pancks
      really thought so or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘When that was gone, sir,’ resumed Pancks, ‘and it did go, though I
      dribbled it out like so much blood, I had taken Mr Rugg into the secret. I
      proposed to borrow of Mr Rugg (or of Miss Rugg; it’s the same thing; she
      made a little money by a speculation in the Common Pleas once). He lent it
      at ten, and thought that pretty high. But Mr Rugg’s a red-haired man, sir,
      and gets his hair cut. And as to the crown of his hat, it’s high. And as
      to the brim of his hat, it’s narrow. And there’s no more benevolence
      bubbling out of him, than out of a ninepin.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your own recompense for all this, Mr Pancks,’ said Clennam, ‘ought to be
      a large one.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I don’t mistrust getting it, sir,’ said Pancks. ‘I have made no bargain.
      I owed you one on that score; now I have paid it. Money out of pocket made
      good, time fairly allowed for, and Mr Rugg’s bill settled, a thousand
      pounds would be a fortune to me. That matter I place in your hands. I
      authorize you now to break all this to the family in any way you think
      best. Miss Amy Dorrit will be with Mrs Finching this morning. The sooner
      done the better. Can’t be done too soon.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation took place in Clennam’s bed-room, while he was yet in
      bed. For Mr Pancks had knocked up the house and made his way in, very
      early in the morning; and, without once sitting down or standing still,
      had delivered himself of the whole of his details (illustrated with a
      variety of documents) at the bedside. He now said he would ‘go and look up
      Mr Rugg’, from whom his excited state of mind appeared to require another
      back; and bundling up his papers, and exchanging one more hearty shake of
      the hand with Clennam, he went at full speed down-stairs, and steamed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clennam, of course, resolved to go direct to Mr Casby’s. He dressed and
      got out so quickly that he found himself at the corner of the patriarchal
      street nearly an hour before her time; but he was not sorry to have the
      opportunity of calming himself with a leisurely walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he returned to the street, and had knocked at the bright brass
      knocker, he was informed that she had come, and was shown up-stairs to
      Flora’s breakfast-room. Little Dorrit was not there herself, but Flora
      was, and testified the greatest amazement at seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good gracious, Arthur—Doyce and Clennam!’ cried that lady, ‘who
      would have ever thought of seeing such a sight as this and pray excuse a
      wrapper for upon my word I really never and a faded check too which is
      worse but our little friend is making me, not that I need mind mentioning
      it to you for you must know that there are such things a skirt, and having
      arranged that a trying on should take place after breakfast is the reason
      though I wish not so badly starched.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I ought to make an apology,’ said Arthur, ‘for so early and abrupt a
      visit; but you will excuse it when I tell you the cause.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In times for ever fled Arthur,’ returned Mrs Finching, ‘pray excuse me
      Doyce and Clennam infinitely more correct and though unquestionably
      distant still ‘tis distance lends enchantment to the view, at least I
      don’t mean that and if I did I suppose it would depend considerably on the
      nature of the view, but I’m running on again and you put it all out of my
      head.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him tenderly, and resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘In times for ever fled I was going to say it would have sounded strange
      indeed for Arthur Clennam—Doyce and Clennam naturally quite
      different—to make apologies for coming here at any time, but that is
      past and what is past can never be recalled except in his own case as poor
      Mr F. said when he was in spirits Cucumber and therefore never ate it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was making the tea when Arthur came in, and now hastily finished that
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Papa,’ she said, all mystery and whisper, as she shut down the tea-pot
      lid, ‘is sitting prosingly breaking his new laid egg in the back parlour
      over the City article exactly like the Woodpecker Tapping and need never
      know that you are here, and our little friend you are well aware may be
      fully trusted when she comes down from cutting out on the large table
      overhead.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur then told her, in the fewest words, that it was their little friend
      he came to see; and what he had to announce to their little friend. At
      which astounding intelligence, Flora clasped her hands, fell into a
      tremble, and shed tears of sympathy and pleasure, like the good-natured
      creature she really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘For gracious sake let me get out of the way first,’ said Flora, putting
      her hands to her ears and moving towards the door, ‘or I know I shall go
      off dead and screaming and make everybody worse, and the dear little thing
      only this morning looking so nice and neat and good and yet so poor and
      now a fortune is she really and deserves it too! and might I mention it to
      Mr F.‘s Aunt Arthur not Doyce and Clennam for this once or if
      objectionable not on any account.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Arthur nodded his free permission, since Flora shut out all verbal
      communication. Flora nodded in return to thank him, and hurried out of the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit’s step was already on the stairs, and in another moment she
      was at the door. Do what he could to compose his face, he could not convey
      so much of an ordinary expression into it, but that the moment she saw it
      she dropped her work, and cried, ‘Mr Clennam! What’s the matter?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Nothing, nothing. That is, no misfortune has happened. I have come to
      tell you something, but it is a piece of great good-fortune.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Good-fortune?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Wonderful fortune!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in a window, and her eyes, full of light, were fixed upon his
      face. He put an arm about her, seeing her likely to sink down. She put a
      hand upon that arm, partly to rest upon it, and partly so to preserve
      their relative positions as that her intent look at him should be shaken
      by no change of attitude in either of them. Her lips seemed to repeat
      ‘Wonderful fortune?’ He repeated it again, aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Dear Little Dorrit! Your father.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The ice of the pale face broke at the word, and little lights and shoots
      of expression passed all over it. They were all expressions of pain. Her
      breath was faint and hurried. Her heart beat fast. He would have clasped
      the little figure closer, but he saw that the eyes appealed to him not to
      be moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your father can be free within this week. He does not know it; we must go
      to him from here, to tell him of it. Your father will be free within a few
      days. Your father will be free within a few hours. Remember we must go to
      him from here, to tell him of it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      That brought her back. Her eyes were closing, but they opened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘This is not all the good-fortune. This is not all the wonderful
      good-fortune, my dear Little Dorrit. Shall I tell you more?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips shaped ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your father will be no beggar when he is free. He will want for nothing.
      Shall I tell you more? Remember! He knows nothing of it; we must go to
      him, from here, to tell him of it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to entreat him for a little time. He held her in his arm, and,
      after a pause, bent down his ear to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Did you ask me to go on?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He will be a rich man. He is a rich man. A great sum of money is waiting
      to be paid over to him as his inheritance; you are all henceforth very
      wealthy. Bravest and best of children, I thank Heaven that you are
      rewarded!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he kissed her, she turned her head towards his shoulder, and raised her
      arm towards his neck; cried out ‘Father! Father! Father!’ and swooned
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Flora returned to take care of her, and hovered about her on a
      sofa, intermingling kind offices and incoherent scraps of conversation in
      a manner so confounding, that whether she pressed the Marshalsea to take a
      spoonful of unclaimed dividends, for it would do her good; or whether she
      congratulated Little Dorrit’s father on coming into possession of a
      hundred thousand smelling-bottles; or whether she explained that she put
      seventy-five thousand drops of spirits of lavender on fifty thousand
      pounds of lump sugar, and that she entreated Little Dorrit to take that
      gentle restorative; or whether she bathed the foreheads of Doyce and
      Clennam in vinegar, and gave the late Mr F. more air; no one with any
      sense of responsibility could have undertaken to decide. A tributary
      stream of confusion, moreover, poured in from an adjoining bedroom, where
      Mr F.‘s Aunt appeared, from the sound of her voice, to be in a horizontal
      posture, awaiting her breakfast; and from which bower that inexorable lady
      snapped off short taunts, whenever she could get a hearing, as, ‘Don’t
      believe it’s his doing!’ and ‘He needn’t take no credit to himself for
      it!’ and ‘It’ll be long enough, I expect, afore he’ll give up any of his
      own money!’ all designed to disparage Clennam’s share in the discovery,
      and to relieve those inveterate feelings with which Mr F.‘s Aunt regarded
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Little Dorrit’s solicitude to get to her father, and to carry the
      joyful tidings to him, and not to leave him in his jail a moment with this
      happiness in store for him and still unknown to him, did more for her
      speedy restoration than all the skill and attention on earth could have
      done. ‘Come with me to my dear father. Pray come and tell my dear father!’ 
      were the first words she said. Her father, her father. She spoke of
      nothing but him, thought of nothing but him. Kneeling down and pouring out
      her thankfulness with uplifted hands, her thanks were for her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flora’s tenderness was quite overcome by this, and she launched out among
      the cups and saucers into a wonderful flow of tears and speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I declare,’ she sobbed, ‘I never was so cut up since your mama and my
      papa not Doyce and Clennam for this once but give the precious little
      thing a cup of tea and make her put it to her lips at least pray Arthur
      do, not even Mr F.‘s last illness for that was of another kind and gout is
      not a child’s affection though very painful for all parties and Mr F. a
      martyr with his leg upon a rest and the wine trade in itself inflammatory
      for they will do it more or less among themselves and who can wonder, it
      seems like a dream I am sure to think of nothing at all this morning and
      now Mines of money is it really, but you must know my darling love because
      you never will be strong enough to tell him all about it upon teaspoons,
      mightn’t it be even best to try the directions of my own medical man for
      though the flavour is anything but agreeable still I force myself to do it
      as a prescription and find the benefit, you’d rather not why no my dear
      I’d rather not but still I do it as a duty, everybody will congratulate
      you some in earnest and some not and many will congratulate you with all
      their hearts but none more so I do assure you from the bottom of my own I
      do myself though sensible of blundering and being stupid, and will be
      judged by Arthur not Doyce and Clennam for this once so good-bye darling
      and God bless you and may you be very happy and excuse the liberty, vowing
      that the dress shall never be finished by anybody else but shall be laid
      by for a keepsake just as it is and called Little Dorrit though why that
      strangest of denominations at any time I never did myself and now I never
      shall!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Flora, in taking leave of her favourite. Little Dorrit thanked her,
      and embraced her, over and over again; and finally came out of the house
      with Clennam, and took coach for the Marshalsea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strangely unreal ride through the old squalid streets, with a
      sensation of being raised out of them into an airy world of wealth and
      grandeur. When Arthur told her that she would soon ride in her own
      carriage through very different scenes, when all the familiar experiences
      would have vanished away, she looked frightened. But when he substituted
      her father for herself, and told her how he would ride in his carriage,
      and how great and grand he would be, her tears of joy and innocent pride
      fell fast. Seeing that the happiness her mind could realise was all
      shining upon him, Arthur kept that single figure before her; and so they
      rode brightly through the poor streets in the prison neighbourhood to
      carry him the great news.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr Chivery, who was on duty, admitted them into the Lodge, he saw
      something in their faces which filled him with astonishment. He stood
      looking after them, when they hurried into the prison, as though he
      perceived that they had come back accompanied by a ghost a-piece. Two or
      three Collegians whom they passed, looked after them too, and presently
      joining Mr Chivery, formed a little group on the Lodge steps, in the midst
      of which there spontaneously originated a whisper that the Father was
      going to get his discharge. Within a few minutes, it was heard in the
      remotest room in the College.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit opened the door from without, and they both entered. He was
      sitting in his old grey gown and his old black cap, in the sunlight by the
      window, reading his newspaper. His glasses were in his hand, and he had
      just looked round; surprised at first, no doubt, by her step upon the
      stairs, not expecting her until night; surprised again, by seeing Arthur
      Clennam in her company. As they came in, the same unwonted look in both of
      them which had already caught attention in the yard below, struck him. He
      did not rise or speak, but laid down his glasses and his newspaper on the
      table beside him, and looked at them with his mouth a little open and his
      lips trembling. When Arthur put out his hand, he touched it, but not with
      his usual state; and then he turned to his daughter, who had sat down
      close beside him with her hands upon his shoulder, and looked attentively
      in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Father! I have been made so happy this morning!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You have been made so happy, my dear?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘By Mr Clennam, father. He brought me such joyful and wonderful
      intelligence about you! If he had not with his great kindness and
      gentleness, prepared me for it, father—prepared me for it, father—I
      think I could not have borne it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her agitation was exceedingly great, and the tears rolled down her face.
      He put his hand suddenly to his heart, and looked at Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Compose yourself, sir,’ said Clennam, ‘and take a little time to think.
      To think of the brightest and most fortunate accidents of life. We have
      all heard of great surprises of joy. They are not at an end, sir. They are
      rare, but not at an end.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam? Not at an end? Not at an end for—’ He touched himself
      upon the breast, instead of saying ‘me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No,’ returned Clennam.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What surprise,’ he asked, keeping his left hand over his heart, and there
      stopping in his speech, while with his right hand he put his glasses
      exactly level on the table: ‘what such surprise can be in store for me?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Let me answer with another question. Tell me, Mr Dorrit, what surprise
      would be the most unlooked for and the most acceptable to you. Do not be
      afraid to imagine it, or to say what it would be.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked steadfastly at Clennam, and, so looking at him, seemed to change
      into a very old haggard man. The sun was bright upon the wall beyond the
      window, and on the spikes at top. He slowly stretched out the hand that
      had been upon his heart, and pointed at the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is down,’ said Clennam. ‘Gone!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained in the same attitude, looking steadfastly at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And in its place,’ said Clennam, slowly and distinctly, ‘are the means to
      possess and enjoy the utmost that they have so long shut out. Mr Dorrit,
      there is not the smallest doubt that within a few days you will be free,
      and highly prosperous. I congratulate you with all my soul on this change
      of fortune, and on the happy future into which you are soon to carry the
      treasure you have been blest with here—the best of all the riches
      you can have elsewhere—the treasure at your side.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words, he pressed his hand and released it; and his daughter,
      laying her face against his, encircled him in the hour of his prosperity
      with her arms, as she had in the long years of his adversity encircled him
      with her love and toil and truth; and poured out her full heart in
      gratitude, hope, joy, blissful ecstasy, and all for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I shall see him as I never saw him yet. I shall see my dear love, with
      the dark cloud cleared away. I shall see him, as my poor mother saw him
      long ago. O my dear, my dear! O father, father! O thank God, thank God!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He yielded himself to her kisses and caresses, but did not return them,
      except that he put an arm about her. Neither did he say one word. His
      steadfast look was now divided between her and Clennam, and he began to
      shake as if he were very cold. Explaining to Little Dorrit that he would
      run to the coffee-house for a bottle of wine, Arthur fetched it with all
      the haste he could use. While it was being brought from the cellar to the
      bar, a number of excited people asked him what had happened; when he
      hurriedly informed them that Mr Dorrit had succeeded to a fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      On coming back with the wine in his hand, he found that she had placed her
      father in his easy chair, and had loosened his shirt and neckcloth. They
      filled a tumbler with wine, and held it to his lips. When he had swallowed
      a little, he took the glass himself and emptied it. Soon after that, he
      leaned back in his chair and cried, with his handkerchief before his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this had lasted a while Clennam thought it a good season for
      diverting his attention from the main surprise, by relating its details.
      Slowly, therefore, and in a quiet tone of voice, he explained them as best
      he could, and enlarged on the nature of Pancks’s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘He shall be—ha—he shall be handsomely recompensed, sir,’ said
      the Father, starting up and moving hurriedly about the room. ‘Assure
      yourself, Mr Clennam, that everybody concerned shall be—ha—shall
      be nobly rewarded. No one, my dear sir, shall say that he has an
      unsatisfied claim against me. I shall repay the—hum—the
      advances I have had from you, sir, with peculiar pleasure. I beg to be
      informed at your earliest convenience, what advances you have made my
      son.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no purpose in going about the room, but he was not still a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Everybody,’ he said, ‘shall be remembered. I will not go away from here
      in anybody’s debt. All the people who have been—ha—well
      behaved towards myself and my family, shall be rewarded. Chivery shall be
      rewarded. Young John shall be rewarded. I particularly wish, and intend,
      to act munificently, Mr Clennam.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Will you allow me,’ said Arthur, laying his purse on the table, ‘to
      supply any present contingencies, Mr Dorrit? I thought it best to bring a
      sum of money for the purpose.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir, thank you. I accept with readiness, at the present
      moment, what I could not an hour ago have conscientiously taken. I am
      obliged to you for the temporary accommodation. Exceedingly temporary, but
      well timed—well timed.’ His hand had closed upon the money, and he
      carried it about with him. ‘Be so kind, sir, as to add the amount to those
      former advances to which I have already referred; being careful, if you
      please, not to omit advances made to my son. A mere verbal statement of
      the gross amount is all I shall—ha—all I shall require.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      His eye fell upon his daughter at this point, and he stopped for a moment
      to kiss her, and to pat her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It will be necessary to find a milliner, my love, and to make a speedy
      and complete change in your very plain dress. Something must be done with
      Maggy too, who at present is—ha—barely respectable, barely
      respectable. And your sister, Amy, and your brother. And <i>my</i>
      brother, your uncle—poor soul, I trust this will rouse him—messengers
      must be despatched to fetch them. They must be informed of this. We must
      break it to them cautiously, but they must be informed directly. We owe it
      as a duty to them and to ourselves, from this moment, not to let them—hum—not
      to let them do anything.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the first intimation he had ever given, that he was privy to the
      fact that they did something for a livelihood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still jogging about the room, with the purse clutched in his hand,
      when a great cheering arose in the yard. ‘The news has spread already,’ 
      said Clennam, looking down from the window. ‘Will you show yourself to
      them, Mr Dorrit? They are very earnest, and they evidently wish it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I—hum—ha—I confess I could have desired, Amy my dear,’ 
      he said, jogging about in a more feverish flutter than before, ‘to have
      made some change in my dress first, and to have bought a—hum—a
      watch and chain. But if it must be done as it is, it—ha—it
      must be done. Fasten the collar of my shirt, my dear. Mr Clennam, would
      you oblige me—hum—with a blue neckcloth you will find in that
      drawer at your elbow. Button my coat across at the chest, my love. It
      looks—ha—it looks broader, buttoned.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      With his trembling hand he pushed his grey hair up, and then, taking
      Clennam and his daughter for supporters, appeared at the window leaning on
      an arm of each. The Collegians cheered him very heartily, and he kissed
      his hand to them with great urbanity and protection. When he withdrew into
      the room again, he said ‘Poor creatures!’ in a tone of much pity for their
      miserable condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit was deeply anxious that he should lie down to compose
      himself. On Arthur’s speaking to her of his going to inform Pancks that he
      might now appear as soon as he would, and pursue the joyful business to
      its close, she entreated him in a whisper to stay with her until her
      father should be quite calm and at rest. He needed no second entreaty; and
      she prepared her father’s bed, and begged him to lie down. For another
      half-hour or more he would be persuaded to do nothing but go about the
      room, discussing with himself the probabilities for and against the
      Marshal’s allowing the whole of the prisoners to go to the windows of the
      official residence which commanded the street, to see himself and family
      depart for ever in a carriage—which, he said, he thought would be a
      Sight for them. But gradually he began to droop and tire, and at last
      stretched himself upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took her faithful place beside him, fanning him and cooling his
      forehead; and he seemed to be falling asleep (always with the money in his
      hand), when he unexpectedly sat up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, I beg your pardon. Am I to understand, my dear sir, that I
      could—ha—could pass through the Lodge at this moment, and—hum—take
      a walk?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I think not, Mr Dorrit,’ was the unwilling reply. ‘There are certain
      forms to be completed; and although your detention here is now in itself a
      form, I fear it is one that for a little longer has to be observed too.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this he shed tears again.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It is but a few hours, sir,’ Clennam cheerfully urged upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘A few hours, sir,’ he returned in a sudden passion. ‘You talk very easily
      of hours, sir! How long do you suppose, sir, that an hour is to a man who
      is choking for want of air?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his last demonstration for that time; as, after shedding some more
      tears and querulously complaining that he couldn’t breathe, he slowly fell
      into a slumber. Clennam had abundant occupation for his thoughts, as he
      sat in the quiet room watching the father on his bed, and the daughter
      fanning his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Dorrit had been thinking too. After softly putting his grey hair
      aside, and touching his forehead with her lips, she looked towards Arthur,
      who came nearer to her, and pursued in a low whisper the subject of her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mr Clennam, will he pay all his debts before he leaves here?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt. All.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘All the debts for which he had been imprisoned here, all my life and
      longer?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘No doubt.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something of uncertainty and remonstrance in her look; something
      that was not all satisfaction. He wondered to detect it, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘You are glad that he should do so?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Are you?’ asked Little Dorrit, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Am I? Most heartily glad!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Then I know I ought to be.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And are you not?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘It seems to me hard,’ said Little Dorrit, ‘that he should have lost so
      many years and suffered so much, and at last pay all the debts as well. It
      seems to me hard that he should pay in life and money both.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear child—’ Clennam was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Yes, I know I am wrong,’ she pleaded timidly, ‘don’t think any worse of
      me; it has grown up with me here.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prison, which could spoil so many things, had tainted Little Dorrit’s
      mind no more than this. Engendered as the confusion was, in compassion for
      the poor prisoner, her father, it was the first speck Clennam had ever
      seen, it was the last speck Clennam ever saw, of the prison atmosphere
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought this, and forbore to say another word. With the thought, her
      purity and goodness came before him in their brightest light. The little
      spot made them the more beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn out with her own emotions, and yielding to the silence of the room,
      her hand slowly slackened and failed in its fanning movement, and her head
      dropped down on the pillow at her father’s side. Clennam rose softly,
      opened and closed the door without a sound, and passed from the prison,
      carrying the quiet with him into the turbulent streets.

	</hgroup>
<p>And now the day arrived when Mr Dorrit and his family were to leave the
      prison for ever, and the stones of its much-trodden pavement were to know
      them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interval had been short, but he had greatly complained of its length,
      and had been imperious with Mr Rugg touching the delay. He had been high
      with Mr Rugg, and had threatened to employ some one else. He had requested
      Mr Rugg not to presume upon the place in which he found him, but to do his
      duty, sir, and to do it with promptitude. He had told Mr Rugg that he knew
      what lawyers and agents were, and that he would not submit to imposition.
      On that gentleman’s humbly representing that he exerted himself to the
      utmost, Miss Fanny was very short with him; desiring to know what less he
      could do, when he had been told a dozen times that money was no object,
      and expressing her suspicion that he forgot whom he talked to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the Marshal, who was a Marshal of many years’ standing, and with
      whom he had never had any previous difference, Mr Dorrit comported himself
      with severity. That officer, on personally tendering his congratulations,
      offered the free use of two rooms in his house for Mr Dorrit’s occupation
      until his departure. Mr Dorrit thanked him at the moment, and replied that
      he would think of it; but the Marshal was no sooner gone than he sat down
      and wrote him a cutting note, in which he remarked that he had never on
      any former occasion had the honour of receiving his congratulations (which
      was true, though indeed there had not been anything particular to
      congratulate him upon), and that he begged, on behalf of himself and
      family, to repudiate the Marshal’s offer, with all those thanks which its
      disinterested character and its perfect independence of all worldly
      considerations demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his brother showed so dim a glimmering of interest in their
      altered fortunes that it was very doubtful whether he understood them, Mr
      Dorrit caused him to be measured for new raiment by the hosiers, tailors,
      hatters, and bootmakers whom he called in for himself; and ordered that
      his old clothes should be taken from him and burned. Miss Fanny and Mr Tip
      required no direction in making an appearance of great fashion and
      elegance; and the three passed this interval together at the best hotel in
      the neighbourhood—though truly, as Miss Fanny said, the best was
      very indifferent. In connection with that establishment, Mr Tip hired a
      cabriolet, horse, and groom, a very neat turn out, which was usually to be
      observed for two or three hours at a time gracing the Borough High Street,
      outside the Marshalsea court-yard. A modest little hired chariot and pair
      was also frequently to be seen there; in alighting from and entering which
      vehicle, Miss Fanny fluttered the Marshal’s daughters by the display of
      inaccessible bonnets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great deal of business was transacted in this short period. Among other
      items, Messrs Peddle and Pool, solicitors, of Monument Yard, were
      instructed by their client Edward Dorrit, Esquire, to address a letter to
      Mr Arthur Clennam, enclosing the sum of twenty-four pounds nine shillings
      and eightpence, being the amount of principal and interest computed at the
      rate of five per cent. per annum, in which their client believed himself
      to be indebted to Mr Clennam. In making this communication and remittance,
      Messrs Peddle and Pool were further instructed by their client to remind
      Mr Clennam that the favour of the advance now repaid (including gate-fees)
      had not been asked of him, and to inform him that it would not have been
      accepted if it had been openly proffered in his name. With which they
      requested a stamped receipt, and remained his obedient servants. A great
      deal of business had likewise to be done, within the
      so-soon-to-be-orphaned Marshalsea, by Mr Dorrit so long its Father,
      chiefly arising out of applications made to him by Collegians for small
      sums of money. To these he responded with the greatest liberality, and
      with no lack of formality; always first writing to appoint a time at which
      the applicant might wait upon him in his room, and then receiving him in
      the midst of a vast accumulation of documents, and accompanying his
      donation (for he said in every such case, ‘it is a donation, not a loan’)
      with a great deal of good counsel: to the effect that he, the expiring
      Father of the Marshalsea, hoped to be long remembered, as an example that
      a man might preserve his own and the general respect even there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Collegians were not envious. Besides that they had a personal and
      traditional regard for a Collegian of so many years’ standing, the event
      was creditable to the College, and made it famous in the newspapers.
      Perhaps more of them thought, too, than were quite aware of it, that the
      thing might in the lottery of chances have happened to themselves, or that
      something of the sort might yet happen to themselves some day or other.
      They took it very well. A few were low at the thought of being left
      behind, and being left poor; but even these did not grudge the family
      their brilliant reverse. There might have been much more envy in politer
      places. It seems probable that mediocrity of fortune would have been
      disposed to be less magnanimous than the Collegians, who lived from hand
      to mouth—from the pawnbroker’s hand to the day’s dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They got up an address to him, which they presented in a neat frame and
      glass (though it was not afterwards displayed in the family mansion or
      preserved among the family papers); and to which he returned a gracious
      answer. In that document he assured them, in a Royal manner, that he
      received the profession of their attachment with a full conviction of its
      sincerity; and again generally exhorted them to follow his example—which,
      at least in so far as coming into a great property was concerned, there is
      no doubt they would have gladly imitated. He took the same occasion of
      inviting them to a comprehensive entertainment, to be given to the whole
      College in the yard, and at which he signified he would have the honour of
      taking a parting glass to the health and happiness of all those whom he
      was about to leave behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not in person dine at this public repast (it took place at two in
      the afternoon, and his dinners now came in from the hotel at six), but his
      son was so good as to take the head of the principal table, and to be very
      free and engaging. He himself went about among the company, and took
      notice of individuals, and saw that the viands were of the quality he had
      ordered, and that all were served. On the whole, he was like a baron of
      the olden time in a rare good humour. At the conclusion of the repast, he
      pledged his guests in a bumper of old Madeira; and told them that he hoped
      they had enjoyed themselves, and what was more, that they would enjoy
      themselves for the rest of the evening; that he wished them well; and that
      he bade them welcome. His health being drunk with acclamations, he was not
      so baronial after all but that in trying to return thanks he broke down,
      in the manner of a mere serf with a heart in his breast, and wept before
      them all. After this great success, which he supposed to be a failure, he
      gave them ‘Mr Chivery and his brother officers;’ whom he had beforehand
      presented with ten pounds each, and who were all in attendance. Mr Chivery
      spoke to the toast, saying, What you undertake to lock up, lock up; but
      remember that you are, in the words of the fettered African, a man and a
      brother ever. The list of toasts disposed of, Mr Dorrit urbanely went
      through the motions of playing a game of skittles with the Collegian who
      was the next oldest inhabitant to himself; and left the tenantry to their
      diversions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all these occurrences preceded the final day. And now the day arrived
      when he and his family were to leave the prison for ever, and when the
      stones of its much-trodden pavement were to know them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon was the hour appointed for the departure. As it approached, there was
      not a Collegian within doors, nor a turnkey absent. The latter class of
      gentlemen appeared in their Sunday clothes, and the greater part of the
      Collegians were brightened up as much as circumstances allowed. Two or
      three flags were even displayed, and the children put on odds and ends of
      ribbon. Mr Dorrit himself, at this trying time, preserved a serious but
      graceful dignity. Much of his great attention was given to his brother, as
      to whose bearing on the great occasion he felt anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dear Frederick,’ said he, ‘if you will give me your arm we will pass
      among our friends together. I think it is right that we should go out arm
      in arm, my dear Frederick.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Hah!’ said Frederick. ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘And if, my dear Frederick—if you could, without putting any great
      constraint upon yourself, throw a little (pray excuse me, Frederick), a
      little polish into your usual demeanour—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘William, William,’ said the other, shaking his head, ‘it’s for you to do
      all that. I don’t know how. All forgotten, forgotten!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘But, my dear fellow,’ returned William, ‘for that very reason, if for no
      other, you must positively try to rouse yourself. What you have forgotten
      you must now begin to recall, my dear Frederick. Your position—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Eh?’ said Frederick.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your position, my dear Frederick.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Mine?’ He looked first at his own figure, and then at his brother’s, and
      then, drawing a long breath, cried, ‘Hah, to be sure! Yes, yes, yes.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Your position, my dear Frederick, is now a fine one. Your position, as my
      brother, is a very fine one. And I know that it belongs to your
      conscientious nature to try to become worthy of it, my dear Frederick, and
      to try to adorn it. To be no discredit to it, but to adorn it.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘William,’ said the other weakly, and with a sigh, ‘I will do anything you
      wish, my brother, provided it lies in my power. Pray be so kind as to
      recollect what a limited power mine is. What would you wish me to do
      to-day, brother? Say what it is, only say what it is.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘My dearest Frederick, nothing. It is not worth troubling so good a heart
      as yours with.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Pray trouble it,’ returned the other. ‘It finds it no trouble, William,
      to do anything it can for you.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      William passed his hand across his eyes, and murmured with august
      satisfaction, ‘Blessings on your attachment, my poor dear fellow!’ Then he
      said aloud, ‘Well, my dear Frederick, if you will only try, as we walk
      out, to show that you are alive to the occasion—that you think about
      it—’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What would you advise me to think about it?’ returned his submissive
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Oh! my dear Frederick, how can I answer you? I can only say what, in
      leaving these good people, I think myself.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘That’s it!’ cried his brother. ‘That will help me.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I find that I think, my dear Frederick, and with mixed emotions in which
      a softened compassion predominates, What will they do without me!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘True,’ returned his brother. ‘Yes, yes, yes, yes. I’ll think that as we
      go, What will they do without my brother! Poor things! What will they do
      without him!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Twelve o’clock having just struck, and the carriage being reported ready
      in the outer court-yard, the brothers proceeded down-stairs arm-in-arm.
      Edward Dorrit, Esquire (once Tip), and his sister Fanny followed, also
      arm-in-arm; Mr Plornish and Maggy, to whom had been entrusted the removal
      of such of the family effects as were considered worth removing, followed,
      bearing bundles and burdens to be packed in a cart.

    <p>
      In the yard, were the Collegians and turnkeys. In the yard, were Mr Pancks
      and Mr Rugg, come to see the last touch given to their work. In the yard,
      was Young John making a new epitaph for himself, on the occasion of his
      dying of a broken heart. In the yard, was the Patriarchal Casby, looking
      so tremendously benevolent that many enthusiastic Collegians grasped him
      fervently by the hand, and the wives and female relatives of many more
      Collegians kissed his hand, nothing doubting that he had done it all. In
      the yard, was the man with the shadowy grievance respecting the Fund which
      the Marshal embezzled, who had got up at five in the morning to complete
      the copying of a perfectly unintelligible history of that transaction,
      which he had committed to Mr Dorrit’s care, as a document of the last
      importance, calculated to stun the Government and effect the Marshal’s
      downfall. In the yard, was the insolvent whose utmost energies were always
      set on getting into debt, who broke into prison with as much pains as
      other men have broken out of it, and who was always being cleared and
      complimented; while the insolvent at his elbow—a mere little,
      snivelling, striving tradesman, half dead of anxious efforts to keep out
      of debt—found it a hard matter, indeed, to get a Commissioner to
      release him with much reproof and reproach. In the yard, was the man of
      many children and many burdens, whose failure astonished everybody; in the
      yard, was the man of no children and large resources, whose failure
      astonished nobody. There, were the people who were always going out
      to-morrow, and always putting it off; there, were the people who had come
      in yesterday, and who were much more jealous and resentful of this freak
      of fortune than the seasoned birds. There, were some who, in pure meanness
      of spirit, cringed and bowed before the enriched Collegian and his family;
      there, were others who did so really because their eyes, accustomed to the
      gloom of their imprisonment and poverty, could not support the light of
      such bright sunshine. There, were many whose shillings had gone into his
      pocket to buy him meat and drink; but none who were now obtrusively Hail
      fellow well met! with him, on the strength of that assistance. It was
      rather to be remarked of the caged birds, that they were a little shy of
      the bird about to be so grandly free, and that they had a tendency to
      withdraw themselves towards the bars, and seem a little fluttered as he
      passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these spectators the little procession, headed by the two
      brothers, moved slowly to the gate. Mr Dorrit, yielding to the vast
      speculation how the poor creatures were to get on without him, was great,
      and sad, but not absorbed. He patted children on the head like Sir Roger
      de Coverley going to church, he spoke to people in the background by their
      Christian names, he condescended to all present, and seemed for their
      consolation to walk encircled by the legend in golden characters, ‘Be
      comforted, my people! Bear it!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      At last three honest cheers announced that he had passed the gate, and
      that the Marshalsea was an orphan. Before they had ceased to ring in the
      echoes of the prison walls, the family had got into their carriage, and
      the attendant had the steps in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and not before, ‘Good Gracious!’ cried Miss Fanny all at once,
      ‘Where’s Amy!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father had thought she was with her sister. Her sister had thought she
      was ‘somewhere or other.’ They had all trusted to finding her, as they had
      always done, quietly in the right place at the right moment. This going
      away was perhaps the very first action of their joint lives that they had
      got through without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute might have been consumed in the ascertaining of these points,
      when Miss Fanny, who, from her seat in the carriage, commanded the long
      narrow passage leading to the Lodge, flushed indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Now I do say, Pa,’ cried she, ‘that this is disgraceful!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘What is disgraceful, Fanny?’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘I do say,’ she repeated, ‘this is perfectly infamous! Really almost
      enough, even at such a time as this, to make one wish one was dead! Here
      is that child Amy, in her ugly old shabby dress, which she was so
      obstinate about, Pa, which I over and over again begged and prayed her to
      change, and which she over and over again objected to, and promised to
      change to-day, saying she wished to wear it as long as ever she remained
      in there with you—which was absolutely romantic nonsense of the
      lowest kind—here is that child Amy disgracing us to the last moment
      and at the last moment, by being carried out in that dress after all. And
      by that Mr Clennam too!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The offence was proved, as she delivered the indictment. Clennam appeared
      at the carriage-door, bearing the little insensible figure in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘She has been forgotten,’ he said, in a tone of pity not free from
      reproach. ‘I ran up to her room (which Mr Chivery showed me) and found the
      door open, and that she had fainted on the floor, dear child. She appeared
      to have gone to change her dress, and to have sunk down overpowered. It
      may have been the cheering, or it may have happened sooner. Take care of
      this poor cold hand, Miss Dorrit. Don’t let it fall.’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      ‘Thank you, sir,’ returned Miss Dorrit, bursting into tears. ‘I believe I
      know what to do, if you will give me leave. Dear Amy, open your eyes,
      that’s a love! Oh, Amy, Amy, I really am so vexed and ashamed! Do rouse
      yourself, darling! Oh, why are they not driving on! Pray, Pa, do drive
      on!’ 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant, getting between Clennam and the carriage-door, with a sharp
      ‘By your leave, sir!’ bundled up the steps, and they drove away.
